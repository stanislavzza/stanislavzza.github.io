Much of the content is new, using a general model to explain the features of existing methods from the measurement literature, in the context of more modern approaches from the machine learning (ML) literature. The synthesis of these two fields is the t-a-p model, which combines the intuitiveness of the measurement ideas with the statistical power of the ML algorithms.\nIf you are new to t-a-p models, I recommend starting with the Chapter 1, which introduces rater agreement as a classification problem and lays out the philosophical and statistical assumptions. Chapter 2 provides the basic statistical derivations needed to work with t-a-p models. Chapter 3 derives the relationship to some existing rater agreement statistics, for example showing how the Fleiss kappa is a special case of a t-a-p model. Chapter 4 expands the number of parameters and shows how this relates to the “kappa paradox.” Chapter 5 allows each rater and/or subject to have individual parameters for accuracy and truth, and allows for independent variables to be used as regression inputs. Chapter 6 reviews some of the machine learning algorithms similar to t-a-p models. Chapter 7 introduces the tapModel R package, which allows for easy estimation of the model parameters. Chapter 8 introduces the t-a-p app, an interactive way to use real or simulated data to estimate the model parameters without coding.\nAn appendix is included to provide more detailed statistical derivations and proofs for some results.\nThe Kappa Zoo will eventually include a collection of real-world data sets and the model parameters estimated from them.\nThis is a work in progress.

    "text": "This chapter gives a brief background on rater agreement with a focus on the goals of the project and how legacy methods fall short. It contrasts psychological measurement methods to machine learning algorithms. A general model is introduced that combines the best features of both of those cultures, and an example is given.\n\n\nHumans often use consensus to assess knowledge. We might seek a second opinion for a diagnosis, ask around for restaurant recommendations, or look for online reviews of a product. Intiuitively, we put more weight on opinions that have more agreement. This chapter describes how agreement or disagreement can be quantified. These agreement statistics are restricted to situations where the assessments are made independently and where each subject is assessed at least twice. The combination of independence and repeatability are abbreviated in probability theory as “iid” for “independent and identically distributed.” This is a powerful assumption that allows us to reach strong conclusions. However, it is not always realistic.\nIn behavioral science, the focus of these statistics is on human observers who we’ll call “raters.” Raters assign “ratings” to “subjects.” This describes a familiar case like a product review with a five-star rating system. However, the same idea applies to any categorization task, like classifying images of cats and dogs, or diagnosing diseases from medical images. A fascinating example comes from an article in The Atlantic Magazine, here describing an analysis of a very old text called the Voynich manuscript.\n\nDavis magnified the handwriting, she noticed subtle variations. In certain places, the script was more cramped or more likely to slant as it crossed the page. She tested this observation by picking a letter that didn’t appear often and tracking it across the manuscript’s pages. Its style, she saw, varied among groups of pages but not within those groups. This suggested that the differences—larger or smaller loops, straighter or curvier crossbars, longer or shorter feet—were the product of different scribes rather than of one scribe writing the same letter in different ways.\n\nSee Davis’s paper for details1. For our purposes, the “raters” are scholars who categorize writing styles, the “subjects” are sections (folios) of the manuscript they are reviewing, and the presumed different scribes are the categories we generically refer to as “ratings.”\n\n\n\nTable 1: Selected rows from a table at the website for the manuscript: https://voynich.nu/index.html, comparing an early attempt to classify writing “hands” (Currier) to the recent classification (Davis). Hypothesized identity is unique to each column with the numbers denoting individual scribes.\n\n\n\n\n\nFolio(s)\nPrescott Currier\nLisa Fagin Davis\n\n\n\n\nf41, f48, f57r\n2\n5\n\n\nfRos (obverse)\n3\n2\n\n\nfRos (main)\n3\n4\n\n\nf87, f88, f93, 96\n4\n1\n\n\nf94, f95\n5\n3\n\n\nf103, f104, f106\nX\n3\n\n\nf105\nY\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Table 1 it’s recorded that Currier thought that the obverse and main folio fRos were in a single hand, whereas Davis has two scribes. Conversely, Davis has the last three rows as the same author while Currier has three. This is an example of how science works toward consensus by placing observations into categories. Agreements are good for pointing to what might be real, and disagreements are for honing or discarding theories.\nThe statistical question for data like this is to compare variation within groups to variation between groups. One application is an idea called “signal-to-noise ratio,” which is a measure of how much of the variation in the data is due to the thing we’re interested in (signal) versus how much is due to random variation (noise). In the manuscript example, the signal is the commonality of handwriting within contiguous sections, and the noise is variation within each section. Reliability of measures is the same idea in different clothing, where we might formulate reliability as between-subject variation divided by total variation. As an example, college grade averages (GPA) can have a reliability of about 0.8, meaning that 80% of the variation in grades is due to differences between students, and 20% is due to variation in how individual students earn grades. This makes GPA useful as a statistical measure, for example in predicting career outcomes.\nHow do we summarize a data set to sort signal from noise? This question involves a deeper question about the true categorization of subjects.\n\n\n\nIt turns out that the questions “what is true?” and “what is knowledge, anyway?” are difficult to answer. There is a great body of work in epistemology, the philosophical study of knowledge, from which we can take a clever idea to get started.\nTo start, we have to imagine that “truth” exists. Since we are talking about classifications of subjects into one of two categories, we must commit to the idea that these categories (words that humans made up) might correspond to something in objective reality (whatever that is). We can easily make up descriptions that are fantasies, like unicorns or flying whales, and the goal is to have a way to distinguish these phantasms from real things like penguins and taxes. To do so, we have to imagine that by some mysterious means, our intellects and discourse can access Nature and name things.\nWords are slippery things, however. Although there are definitions, the real meaning of “pizza” is (ironically) ineffable; one could write volumes on the subject. Let’s take Platos’s definition of a man as a featherless biped. Our goal is a set of classifications “man” or “not man” generated from independent observers (we call them raters) who each inspect some objects in the world (we call them subjects) and assign “man” or “not man” to each. Then we’ll take that data and apply the between- and within-variance idea.\nTherefore the definition isn’t enough. We also need a procedure for generating the data the way we want. To ensure independence of raters, we don’t want them to collaborate on decisions, for example. In the sciences, procedures can be quite elaborate, as in detecting and classifying Higgs bosons, which requires a huge particle accelerator.\nThe story is that Diogneses the Cynic tossed a plucked chicken at Plato’s feet and declared “here’s your man.” The example drives a wedge between the definition “featherless biped” and what is actually meant by “man.” Outside of math and science, definitions and procedures are fuzzy in this way. Rater agreement statistics attempt to defuzz the ratings, to understand the reality behind them.\nHere’s where the idea from epistemology is key, because it gets to the nature of the fuzziness of classification. First we define knowledge as justified true belief (JTB), and then sort out where the fuzziness is.\nThere are three parts to JTB, and we already talked about truth; as a prerequisite we must believe that true statements can be made about the world, which means accessing something real and describing it. The third piece of JTB is belief, which we’ll take to be the classification assigned by a rater. If our rater looks at a horse and writes down “not unicorn,” we’ll assume that the classification represents what the rater believes. This runs into problems if we want to consider adversarial raters, like someone paid to rate consumer products, or an angry customer rating a service poorly for extraneous reasons. We won’t consider those possibilities here.\nThe first piece of JTB is where the fuzziness lives: justification. Outside of math, justification in words isn’t complete2. In the case of Diogenes versus Plato, an follower of the latter might reason that the plucked chicken meets the great philosopher’s definition, and therefore is a man. Others might use common sense to conclude that it’s not a man. There is more than one way to justify belief, but not all of them result in true classifications.\nThe JTB idea was dealt a blow by Gettier, who posed a number of examples where justification goes awry, but the idea is much older. Consider this example from Dharmottara in 779 AD3.\n\nA desert traveller is searching for water. He sees, in the valley ahead, a shimmering blue expanse. Unfortunately, it’s a mirage. But fortunately, when he reaches the spot where there appeared to be water, there actually is water, hidden under a rock. Did the traveller know, as he stood on the hilltop hallucinating, that there was water ahead?\n\nThe traveller had a belief that turned out to be true, but the justification was incorrect. The philosphers are concerned with whether or not this constitutes knowledge4, but we’re more interested in something simpler. That is to categorize the ways truth and belief can happen. If they don’t coincide (if we believe something false), then we’ll assume that the justification was incorrect. As the Gettier problems and the discussion they generated demonstrate, there are a lot of complicated ways in which justification can go awry.\nIn the literature of rater agreement, one can find similar language. In Aickin (1990), we find “The \\(\\alpha\\) agreement parameter is defined as the proportion of a population of items that are classified identically ‘for cause’ by two classifiers, the remaining items being classified at random […].” The author suggests that some subjects are more difficult to rate than others, which hints at modeling each subject’s probability of being in a category, in truth. This idea was explored in Dawid & Skene (1979), who also allowed that raters might have different proficiencies.\nAnother instance comes from the derivation of a rater agreement statistic called AC1 Gwet (2008). The author notes that “the assumption [is] that any rating that is not random will automatically lead to a correct classification, while a random rating leads to a correct classification with probability 1/2.” The idea is that we conceptually separate accurate ratings from random ones, which then means we must consider the probability distribution of the random ones. The random assignments will sometimes be correct, but for the wrong reason–just like the Gettier problems.\n\n\n\nDiagnosing illness is an important classification problem, and the simplest version is a blood test that returns a positive or negative result, perhaps scanning for an antibody. There are four possibilities, which can be organized into what is commonly called a confusion matrix. Suppose that we consider a statement S about the world, like “this patient has the flu.” Using a definition and process we reach a conclusion, so that we believe S to be true or false. This generates the classifications we’re interested in: this is what the raters do, generating lots of S or not-S data on cases.\nThe truth is often inaccessible, but recall that we assume that it exists, so that the statement really is true or false: each patient really does have the flu or does not. Here are the four possibilities:\n\n\n\nTable 2: Sample confusion matrix\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nS is true\nS is false\n\n\n\n\nBelieve S is true\nTrue positive cases\nFalse positive cases\n\n\nBelieve S is false.\nFalse negative cases\nTrue negative cases\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that there are four spots in the table where data can go: if we had perfect knowledge we could count the number of true positive cases, etc. If we converted these numbers to proportions by dividing by the table, we have three parameters left. This foreshadows what comes later: the heart of the classification problem (in its simple form) is a three-parameter problem5.\nThe limitation of casting the confusion matrix into a single-parameter statistic was noted by Cicchetti & Feinstein (1990), who suggested “two separate indexes of proportionate agreement in the observers’ positive and negative decisions. […] Why do we want a single index?” Another example comes from the motivation for the AC1 rater statistic Gwet (2008). It separately considers rater true positives and true negatives, but then assumes that these are identical for each rater, so that the result is a single parameter.\nAs a concrete illustration, consider the wine judging data used in Hodgson (2008). The first five rows look like this:\n\n\n\nTable 3: Wine ratings showing rows 1-5 of 183, taken from the study by Hodgson (personal communication).\n\n\n\n\n\nWine\nJ1\nJ2\nJ3\nJ4\n\n\n\n\n1\n3\n3\n3\n3\n\n\n2\n3\n3\n3\n3\n\n\n3\n3\n3\n2\n4\n\n\n4\n3\n4\n3\n1\n\n\n5\n4\n2\n1\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 1-4 scale is ordinal, meaning that we imagine quality to increase with the numerical value. For this discussion, we will reduce the scale to a binary classification: acceptable wine (ratings 2-4) or wine to avoid (rating 1). This simplifies the table to.\n\n\n\nTable 4: Simplified wine ratings, where 1 means “acceptable” and 0 means “avoid.”\n\n\n\n\n\nWine\nJ1\nJ2\nJ3\nJ4\n\n\n\n\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n\n\n2\n1\n1\n1\n1\n\n\n3\n1\n1\n0\n1\n\n\n4\n1\n1\n1\n0\n\n\n5\n1\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntuitively there is more reason to believe wines 1 and 2 are acceptable than with 3 or 4, for which one judge found them not metal-worthy. It seems safe to avoid wine 5, since all but one of the judges found it not to be metal-worthy.\nWe can put this information into the confusion matrix, but we’re missing information.\n\n\n\nTable 5: Confusion matrix for the first five wines, with missing information as question marks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntrue value of 2-4\ntrue value of 1\nTotal\n\n\n\n\nrating of 2-4\n?\n?\n15\n\n\nrating of 1\n?\n?\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is some awkwardness in imagining that the physical universe encompasses a reality including true wine ratings. It seems absurd on the face of it that the physical laws of the universe imply “wine science.” It’s useful to think of it in reverse: this reification of the ratings is a hypothesis that may be rejected by the statistics we derive from the data. If we find that raters are assigning ratings at random, there’s no evidence here for the reality of wine asthetics. On the other hand, strong indications of non-randomness need to be explained somehow.\nTaking the leap that all non-randomness is causal, and physical reality has a monopoly on causality, then something concrete in the world is behind the rating consistency. We could imagine the chemical similarities and differences of wines and their effects on human anatomy, and so on. Being “real” in this case doesn’t mean that the universe appreciates wine, only that the universe includes physical blobs called humans, and they have mechanical consistencies that correlate observations in this case. The confusion matrix is also used for calculating the causal effect of an experiment. In a medical context, the rows might be treatment categories and the columns patient outcomes. See Eubanks (2014) for more on that.\nBy using the rating counts for each subject instead of the total, we can–surprisingly–estimate the whole confusion matrix. We can even estimate the true classification values for each subject. For that level of detail see Chapter 4: Hierarchical Models.\n\n\n\nSignal and noise as variability between and variability within subjects translates into rater agreement within subjects versus between subjects. The usual way to turn this idea into a number is to count the number of actual agreements and divide by the total number possible.\n\n\n\nTable 6: Rater agreements count, showing the maximum agreements for N raters, the number matches that are evidence versus logical implications and the ratio of evidence to matches.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of raters\nMaximum agreements\nEvidentiary agreements\nImplied agreements\nEvidence / Maximum\n\n\n\n\n1\n0\n-\n-\n-\n\n\n2\n1\n1\n0\n1\n\n\n3\n3\n2\n1\n.67\n\n\n4\n6\n3\n3\n.5\n\n\n5\n10\n4\n6\n.4\n\n\nN\n\\(N(N-1)/2\\)\n\\(N-1\\)\n\\(N(N-1)/2 - N + 1\\)\n\\(2/N\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe maximum agreements in the table come from the combinatorics formula “N choose 2,” counting the number of possible pairs out of N. If a group of 5 people meet and all shake hands, it’s 10 handshakes. The number of pairs grow much more rapidly than the number of raters does6.\nThere’s a rule in thumb in statistics that it’s preferable to use standard deviation instead of variance when understanding the data. That’s because the units of standard deviation are the same as the original data, whereas the variance has squared units. The same effect is going on with counting agreement. In some sense, what we want looks more like the square root of agreement.\nIntuitively, three raters agreeing doesn’t seem like three times as much evidence as two agreeing. And if we look at where those agreements are coming from, most of them are purely logical. Agreement is transitive, meaning if A agrees with B and B agrees with C, then A agrees with C. This is a logical necessity, and it’s not evidence of anything. The Evidentiary and Implied columns of the table record the distinction between the two types of matches. As the number of raters \\(N\\) increases, the logically necessary agreements greatly outnumber the evidentiary ones, so the ratio in the last column of the table decreases toward zero.\nIf we only counted the evidentiary agreements, the maximum for \\(N\\) raters would be \\(N - 1\\), which is roughly proportional to the square root of the total number of agreements. We’ll come back to that idea later. However, the well-trodden path is to estimate the probability of agreement over all the subjects, which leads to the kappa statistics.\nFor the five wine ratings that are reduced to the binary category “avoid” or “don’t avoid” in Table 4, we can calculate the agreement as follows.\n\n\n\nTable 7: Agreement calculation for the first five wines, showing the maximum possible agreements, the actual agreements, and the agreement proportion out of the maximum.\n\n\n\n\n\nWine\nRaters\nPossible\nActual\nAgreement\n\n\n\n\n1\n4\n6\n6\n1\n\n\n2\n4\n6\n6\n1\n\n\n3\n4\n6\n3\n.5\n\n\n4\n4\n6\n3\n.5\n\n\n5\n4\n6\n3\n.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the fifth vintage in Table 7, there are more matches with the zeros than there are with the ones; both are counted. It is at this point what seemed like a good starting point begins to turn into a muddle, because since both the zeros and the ones can create agreement, how do we know what’s good enough agreement? What’s the worst agreement possible?\nA group of \\(n_1\\) raters who agree on the 1 ratings produces a number of agreements about proportional to \\(n_1^2\\), and similarly the \\(n_0\\) raters of 0 agreements produce about \\(n_0^2\\) agreements. Together that’s around \\(n_1^2 + n_0^2\\) agreements, which is less than or equal to \\((n_1 + n_0)^2\\), which is about the number of agreements if everyone agreed on a single category. So we get more agreement when everyone agrees than we do when the raters split into groups. That means that the least agreement happens when the raters are evenly split, giving us a floor for agreement.\n\n\n\nTable 8: Minimum rater agreement rates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of raters\nMaximum agreements\nMinimum agreements\nMinimum rate\n\n\n\n\n4\n6\n2\n.33\n\n\n6\n15\n6\n.40\n\n\n8\n28\n12\n.43\n\n\n10\n45\n20\n.44\n\n\neven N\n\\(N(N-1)/2\\)\n\\(N(N/2-1)/2\\)\n\\((N/2-1)/(N - )\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor six or more raters, there’s at least a 40% agreement rate, even when there’s the least possible amount of agreement. It’s annoying that the minimum rate of agreement changes with the number of raters. For real cases when we want to use these ideas, we might have different numbers of raters for different subjects, complicating an average minimum rate, which defines the worst case agreement.\n\n\n\nWe saw in the previous section that the minimum frequency of agreement among raters is quite large, tending toward one half of the maximum possible. Whatever statistic we create as a measure of agreement needs to take that into account if we are to make sense of the results. We’ll get maximum agreement if all the raters choose the same category (of the two choices), and we’ll get minimum agreement if they split evenly between the categories, as if they each flipped a coin to decide. So there’s an association between worst-case random raters and the minimum agreement rate. This is the basis of the chance correction in the S statistic, which assumes coin-flipping raters as the worst-case benchmark from which to measure agreement.\nThe general formula for taking into account a worst-case (random) match rate \\(m_r\\) first computes the practical range of our scale, which is \\(1 - m_r\\), since the statistic can’t be less than \\(m_r\\). The amount of agreement observed \\(m_o\\) is then pinned to this scale as a “chance-corrected” match rate \\(\\kappa\\) (kappa) with\n\\[\\kappa = \\frac{m_o - m_r}{1 - m_r}\\]\nThe S statistic is a special case of this formula, where \\(m_r = .5\\). The sample of wine ratings can be used to illustrate. Recall that earlier we simplified the judges’ scale of “no medal” to “gold medal” to a binary classification between “no medal” (coded as zero) or “any medal” (coded as one). There were 30 maximum agreements among the four raters over the five wines (six per wine), and 21 actual agreements. The minimum is when the ratings are evenly split on each case, generating two agreements for each wine, or 10 total. An S-like statistic would be calculated like this:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nm_o &= 21/30 = .70 \\\\\nm_r &= 10/30 = .33 \\\\\n\\kappa_s &= \\frac{.70 - .33}{1 - .33} = .47\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]The kappa is now on a scale of zero (worse) to one (perfect agreement). Interpreting what the value means is difficult because it’s on the wrong scale as noted above. A value close to one half sounds mediocre, but not terrible, but we’re really looking for something like the square root of the agreement rate, which is .69. That value corresponds better to the intuition that the agreement in the table looks pretty good.\nThe coin-flipping assumption for randomness can be replaced with other assumptions. This has the effect of increasing the assumed worst-case agreement rate and hence decreasing kappa values. Perhaps the most popular choice is to reason that the raters are more likely to randomly pick the most common category so the coin should be weighted according to the rating distribution.\nFor example, the table of simplified wine ratings has 15 ratings of 1 and 5 of 0, or 75% 1-ratings. The worst case match rate is then the product of the proportions of 1 ratings, or \\(m_r = (.75)(.75) + (.25)(.25) = .625\\). This is the assumption of the Fleiss kappa. Note that the actual worst case match rate is still close to one half (because of the math), so it’s possible to get a negative Fleiss kappa if the assumption about the distribution of randomness fails.\nOne calculation under this proportionality assumption is:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nm_o &= 21/30 = .70 \\\\\nm_r &= .625 \\\\\n\\kappa_f &= \\frac{.70 - .625}{1 - .625} = .20\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]The actual calculations of these statistics are complicated by the choice of using exact combinatorical counts or long-run estimates. This distinction need not concern us in here.\nThe deflation of the rater agreement statistic in the Fleiss calculation above makes it clear that assumptions about random agreement are critical. A researcher may justifiably wonder which value is correct: are the wine judges in pretty good agreement, or is the judging mostly random? For historical reasons, rather than treating rater disagreement as a parameter to be discovered, the field has evolved to propose many variations of the kappa formula with different assumptions about the worst-case agreement rate.\nA limitation of most of the kappa statistics is that they make the simplifying assumption that a pair of raters reaches agreement randomly if both raters are random. This omits the possibility that one rater is accurate and the other isn’t.\n\n\n\nThere are by now several statistics advertised as rater agreement statistics, including Cohen’s kappa, Fleiss’s kappa, Scott’s pi, Krippendorff’s alpha, S, and AC1. For convenience, these statistics will be referred to generically as “kappas.” Researchers who want a simple answer are faced with a bewildering set of options and claims about them. In Vach & Gerke (2023) we get a sense of the situation.\n\nGwet’s AC1 has been proposed as an alternative to Cohen’s kappa in evaluating the agreement between two binary ratings. This approach is becoming increasingly popular, and researchers have been criticized for still using Cohen’s kappa. However, a rigorous discussion of properties of Gwet’s AC1 is still missing.\n\nThe authors illustrate both the need for clarification and the faddishness that research communities can adopt when lacking real criteria. The kappas are ill-suited to answer such questions, and the proliferation of agreement statistics makes it difficult to compare results across studies or to know which one to use. Given pressures to publish results, there may be a tendency to use the statistic that gives the highest value, or to use the one that is most familiar. See Button et al. (2020) for a discussion of rater agreement statistics in the context of the “crisis in confidence in psychological research.”\nIt’s not just difficult to know what kappa to use, there are no meaningful guides to interpreting the results. “There is a wide distinction in the elucidation of Kappa values, and several efforts have been made to assign practical meaning to calculated Kappa values,” wrote the authors of Chaturvedi & Shweta (2015), who mention a widely-used heuristic found in Landis & Koch (1977) that proposed a translation between numerical values of kappa and qualitative descriptions of agreement, such as \\(\\kappa \\ge .81\\) is “almost perfect.” The categories are arbitrary, do not translate well between different agreement statistics (which can give different values for the same data) and their assumptions, and do not provide insight into how to improve ratings.\nThe agreement statistics for ratings have problems that should now be evident. The goal is to understand a three-dimensional relationship between ratings and true values, but the statistics are single parameters. A second parameter, the worst case baseline, is buried in an assumption, which varies by kappa, and is not tested for fit to the data. The result is a bewildering array of choices for rater agreement measures. As a result of this confusion, different cultures have emerged. If getting published is the goal, then higher agreement rates are more desirable, so a researcher can shop around for the “best” one.\nA research agenda was suggested in Landis & Koch (1977) that can be paraphrased as understanding (1) the true category of each subject, (2) the accuracy of raters, (3) truth and accuracy within sub-populations of subjects, (4) conditions that cause disagreement, and (5) what distinguishes “for cause” agreement and random agreement. Some of this can be accomplished by taking a fresh look at the kappas.\n\n\n\nThe geyser of data produced in the information age has led to new methods of analyzing it that fall generally in the description of “machine learning (ML).” Assigning categories to subjects is a common task in machine learning, and the field has developed a number of methods to do so, including neural networks, support vector machines, and random forests. The goal is to assign categories to subjects in a way that generalizes to new subjects. The methods are often evaluated by comparing the predicted categories to the true categories, and the results are summarized in a confusion matrix. See Carpenter (2008) for a good example of this literature.\nIt may come as a surprise to both behavioral scientists and machine learning researchers that they seem to have independently worked on the rater agreement problem, since the two fields’ literatures don’t seem to overlap. Articles on rater agreement don’t cite machine learning papers, and vice versa. However, the two fields are working on the same problem: how to measure the accuracy of a categorization when we don’t have the true categories to reference.\nThere are differences in the methods and philosophies of the two cultures. The kappa approach is implicitly backward-looking, asking “how accurate were these ratings,” with the assumption that the measured accuracy (a kappa) will carry forward to future instances. The ML approach is more forward-looking, with a suite of tools like cross-validation and a vocabulary (bias-variance trade-off) to measure generalizability. As we have seen, the kappa approach is to reason out a plausible chance-correction calculation and use it to produce the single-parameter kappa. The ML approach is to estimate three parameters with regression models. Finally, the kappas are grounded in the psychology of human classification and come with philosophical links to epistemology, which I described earlier in Section 1.2. The ML algorithms are just statistics and code, barren of philosophical considerations.\nThe advantage of the ML approaches over the kappas is that the three parameter models avoid the confusions of the kappa zoo. But because they lack philosophical grounding, they run into an embarrassment of riches: three parameters is sometimes too many parameters for a model, so there can be multiple solutions. There are work-arounds, but it’s the same species of ad hoc reasoning that causes the problems of the kappa zoo. Fortunately, there’s a way to combine the best of both cultures to avoid most of these problems.\n\n\n\nWe can now describe a regression model that allows us to estimate the four proportions that appear in the confusion matrix (see Section 1.3). Since the four cells sum to one, there are three free parameters to estimate.\n\n: Confusion matrix with entries to be filled in by the model estimates. The four numbers are proportions and sum to one, leaving three free parameters to estimate. C0 = class zero, and C1 = class one, standing in for any binary categories we might choose.\n\n\n\nTrue C1\nTrue C0\n\n\n\n\nClassified C1\n\n\n\n\nClassified C0\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo philosophical assumptions are needed to get started:\n\nThe classifications are real in the sense that true values exist.\nThe true values have a binary causal effect on the classification process.\n\nThese assumptions are provisional like hypothesis in statistics; the evidence will provide some support for the assumptions, ranging from no support at all to quite good. The reality of the truth values posed in assumption one is not like Plato’s cave shadows. In the case of wine judging, we can’t say there is a universal ideal for good wine, but if rater agreement is high we can say that some physical causal process exists for translating the observable subject (tasting the wine) into a category. So in that sense the category exists as part of the world. The translation is imperfect, because the conditions are not always perfect for the cause to happen, as with the Gettier problems7.\nThis may seem fiddly, but it gives us a place to start. For any given subject to be rated (e.g. object to be classified) we provisionally assume that there’s a latent truth value that we can never know, but might find evidence for. The second assumption then allows us to provisionally assume that the causal effect of the true value in the context of the classification process has the following nature:\n\nThe rater either assigns the correct class due to the causal pathway operating to connect the observation to the class (justified true knowledge), or\nSomething goes wrong with the causal pathway (the conditions weren’t quite right, etc.) and the classification is assigned non-causally, which is to say randomly.\n\nThe key to this is that the cause either works to connect the true value to the rater’s assigned value, or it fails completely. There’s no “partial cause.” When it fails, the rating is generated from a random process called a Bernoulli trial. It’s the simplest possible type of randomness, taking only two values with some fixed probability, like flipping a weighted coin.\nLet’s take inventory of the three parameters that come from the reasoning above.\n\nAmong the subjects being rated there is a fraction \\(t\\) that are in reality Class 1, with the remaining \\(1-t\\) being Class 0.\nAmong the ratings there is a fraction \\(a\\) that are accurate ratings (justified true knowledge) where the causal connection worked.\nFor the remaining \\(1-a\\) ratings, the causal connection failed, and there is some probability \\(p\\) that describes the frequency that they are assigned to Class 1. The remaining \\(1-p\\) are assigned Class 0.\n\nAll three of these parameters are proportions ranging from zero to one, and can be treated as probabilities that we estimate from appropriate regression models. Setting it up this way, instead of the usual machine learning parameterization avoids the most significant problem with non-identifiability (multiple solutions), which is class-switching. That happens when the model can fit the data, but is agnostic about which class is which, and so attempts to fit the model both ways at once.\nThe classification model with \\(t\\), \\(a\\), and \\(p\\) can be most easily understood in a tree diagram. For convenience, we’ll put a “bar” over a parameter name to indicate that it’s subtracted from one, e.g. \\(\\bar{t} = 1-t\\). This makes the notation more compact, and we always have \\(a + \\bar{a} = 1\\), etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: tap diagram\n\n\n\nThe diagram in Figure 1 shows probabilistic links between states of the world and rater classifications. The lowercase letters are probabilities (recall that the bar means subtract from one to make the complementary probability, so \\(\\bar{.2} = .8\\)). The upper case letters stand in for binary variables, with \\(T\\) being the (unknown) true classification, which is either Class 1 (\\(C_1\\)) or Class 0 (\\(C_0\\)). The raters assign classifications \\(C\\), which have hats on them to denote empirical assignments rather than true values. We read the tree top to bottom, hence the name for the model: t-a-p, an abbreviation of the tree structure.\nTo understand the model, consider a judge (the rater) tasting one of the wines (the subject at the top of the tree). We’re at the top of the tree, where there exists a true classification for the wine as either acceptable ((\\(C_1\\)) or unacceptable ((\\(C_0\\)). In the universe of wines the fraction of acceptable ones is \\(t\\), and for a given wine we can imagine a hidden variable \\(T\\) that records its true class. Suppose this one is acceptable, so that \\(T = C_1\\). That’s the set-up for the wine taster, who doesn’t know the value of \\(T\\), but is trying to ascertain it. If this assessment is accurate (a case of justified true belief), then we follow the left branch of the diagram again, and the judge’s classification \\(C\\) is assigned the value \\(\\hat{C_1}\\). The hat indicates that this is an empirical rating, so we can keep it distinct from \\(C_1\\), which is the true value. The accurate judgments happen with probability \\(a\\), and if it’s not accurate, the judge’s classification will be randomly determined. The rating will be assigned \\(\\hat{C_1}\\) with probability \\(p\\), and otherwise will get the \\(\\hat{C_0}\\) rating.\nIt’s important to note that the value of \\(T\\) is the same for any given wine. So when four judges all rate the same wine, they are all either on the left side of the diagram (if the wine is acceptable in reality) or on the right side (if not). The ratings are determined only by \\(a\\) and \\(p\\) at that point.\nFor a wine chosen at random, we can compute the probabilities of rater classifications. An acceptable wine will be classified accurately with a proportion of \\(ta\\), multiplying the probabilities along the leftmost edge from top to bottom. An inaccurate rating of \\(\\hat{C_1}\\) (acceptability) can come from either the left or right side of the diagram, and if we add those together we get \\(t\\bar{a}p + \\bar{t}\\bar{a}p\\), and since \\(t + \\bar{t} = 1\\) that expression reduces to \\(\\bar{a}p\\).\nAssuming we can estimate the three parameters from the data, we can then populate the confusion matrix by tracing the diagram down to each of the four outcomes, and multiplying probabilities as we go.\n\n\n\nTable 9: The t-a-p model’s correspondence to the confusion matrix. Terms in parentheses are inaccurate ratings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrue C1\nTrue C0\n\n\n\n\nClassified C1\n\\(ta + (t\\bar{a}p)\\)\n\\((\\bar{t}\\bar{a}p)\\)\n\n\nClassified C0\n\\((t\\bar{a}\\bar{p})\\)\n\\(\\bar{t}a + (\\bar{t}\\bar{a}\\bar{p})\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe entries in Table 9 demonstrate that if the t-a-p model fits the data and we are able to estimate the three parameters, it is a general answer to the rater agreement question. The later sections show how S, Fleiss kappa, and other statistics are special cases of t-a-p models.\n\n\n\nThe sections above used five rows of the wine judging data for illustration. We now use the whole data set of 183 wines each rated by four judges to estimate the t-a-p parameters. The included app was used (see Chapter 7) for the analysis.\nThe binary classification illustrated above was to convert the original scale (1 = no medal, 2 = bronze, 3 = silver, 4 = gold medal) to a binary outcome where 1 = any medal (bronze, silver, gold), and 0 = no medal. We called the Class 1 category “acceptable.” Using the app to analyze that binary comparison we get the following output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Wine rating t-a-p analysis comparing C1 = ratings 1,2,3 (in-class) to C0 = rating 0.\n\n\n\nThe acceptable wines are the primary (in-) class, and the plot shows the distribution of ratings for acceptability. Since there are four judges, the possibilities are:\n\nNone of them could find the wine acceptable. This is the 0 at the left end of the plot. It happens for about 6% of the wines.\nAll four of them could find the wine acceptable. This is the 4 (four judges) at the right end of the plot. That happened for about 49% of the wines.\nSomething in between, where the judges disagree. In that case we can have from one to three ratings of “acceptable,” corresponding to those points on the plot.\n\nThe lollipops (black lines with dots on top) in Figure 2 show the empirical data straight out of the ratings. The dashed blue line is the model fit, showing what the distribution would be if the model were exactly correct. Here, “model” means applying the estimated parameters to generate the distribution.\nThe estimated parameters are found at the top of the plot:\n\n\\(t\\) = .73 estimates that 73% of wines are acceptable in reality. This is more than the rate of unanimous agreement, which we saw above was only 49%.\n\\(a\\) = .54 estimates that the judges make accurate ratings (justified true belief) more than half the time. The rest of the ratings are assumed to be random.\n\\(p\\) = .78 estimates that when random ratings are made, judges choose “acceptable” 78% of the time. Notice that this is close to the estimated actual rate of 73% (the estimated value of \\(t\\) above). This turns out to be a desirable quality in judges. See Chapter 3 for details, especially the section on the Fleiss kappa.\n\nNote that the randomness of inaccurate ratings is not a conscious choice of raters. They aren’t giving up and flipping a coin. They still have a reasonable basis for making a rating, and may be quite confident about it. The assumption is that something Gettier-like has gone wrong with the causal process that links the input (wine) to output (rating), which flips the process from deterministic to stochastic. As with any regression model, the world doesn’t have to actually be that way; it’s just an assumption to allow us to create the model. Then we check to see if the data matches the model. In this case, the data matches the model pretty well, as we can visually assess by comparing the blue dashed line to the lollipops. More formal tests of agreement will have to wait until later.\nThe wine ratings comprise four categories that are naturally ordered from 1 = “no medal” to 4 = “gold medal.” That kind of data is common: from surveys with Strongly Disagree to Strongly Agree scales, from consumer ratings, and many other sources. We humans seem to have a natural facility to think of descriptions along an imaginary intensity scale. This data type is called “ordinal,” meaning we can put the categories in order.\nThe t-a-p model is designed to work with binary data. It’s possible to switch to a multinomial model, but it’s common to analyze ordinal scales using binary distinctions. I’ll show how that works with the wine data. Along the 1,2,3,4 scale, there are three sequential cut-points where the commas are. The first one we can denote “1|2”, which splits the scores into two sets: an in-class {1} and and out-class {2,3,4}. This is the same thing as the Class 1 and Class 0 distinction from earlier. The second cut-point is at 2|3, splitting the data into ratings {1,2} and {3,4}. The plot shows the fraction of ratings in the in- and out-class for each cut-point.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Wine ratings divided into binary groups by cutpoint.\n\n\n\nThe 3|4 bar of the plot shows us that 88% of ratings are in {1,2,3}, so the remaining 12% are 4s (gold medal). As a validity check, there are 183 wines, each rated by four judges, so that should be 732 ratings. That looks like the height on the bars, so it checks out.\nFor a given cut-point, a wine rating will either be in the in-class or out-class This converts the scale to binary, and then we can estimate the model parameters. We repeat the t-a-p model for each cut-point to create a pattern like the one in the plot below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: t-a-p parameter estimates for ordinal scale based on cutpoints\n\n\n\nThe plot in Figure 4 shows each t-a-p parameter for each cut-point. As a reference, the Fleiss kappa estimates are also included as dotted lines. The significance of the Fleiss kappa is discussed later.\nThe accuracy parameter \\(a\\) at the top shows good accuracy for the lowest cut-point, meaning that the judges were good at distinguishing the least worthy wines from the rest. This is the case we analyzed earlier when we called the 1 rating unacceptable. As the quality rating increases, moving to the right on the top plot, accuracy decreases to less than half its value for the first cut-point (focus on the solid line). This would be the case if poor wines have more basis in physiology (sourness, etc.) and as the assessments become more aesthetic, they become more individualized and have less group agreement.\nThe second plot, showing estimates for \\(p\\) show the probability with which judges place a wine randomly into the in-class for inaccurate ratings. This will happen less often for the left-most cut-points, since accuracy is higher there. The dotted line is useful here: it shows what the \\(p\\) parameter would look like if the raters assigned ratings proportionally when making inaccurate classifications. For example, we noted earlier that 88% of the ratings are 1-3 (rightmost bar of the previous plot), so for the 3|4 cut-point, proportional random ratings would assign 88% of the inaccurate ratings into the {1,2,3} in-class. That’s where the dotted line is, at 88%. The actual parameter estimate (solid line) is at about 84%, meaning that judges are probably too conservative about assigning the gold medal category. Accuracy is low for the gold medals, and when the judges rate inaccurately, the ratings are slightly biased toward the lower ratings.\nThe bottom plot in Figure 4 estimates the true proportions for each cut-point, after taking into account the other two parameters. For the 3|4 cut-point on the right, it shows a proportion of {1,2,3} wines of about 65%. This is much lower than the 88% of ratings that are {1,2,3}. That’s the combined effect of inaccurate ratings at the top end of the scale combined with the bias toward lower ratings for inaccurate ratings. Looking at the two ends of the scale for the \\(t\\) plot, we can estimate that about 26% of wines are truly in the 1 = no medal category, and about 35% are in the 4 = gold medal category (1 - .65 = .35). That 35% figure comes from reading the estimated value of \\(t\\) at the 3|4 cut point, which is about 65%, and subtracting from one.\nIt’s possible to tell good wine from bad wine pretty reliably in this data set, but beyond that individual tastes may not be discerning enough to sort out four levels of wine quality. The scale could possibly be reduced to three ratings, or else keep the existing scale but collapse the 3 and 4 ratings into a single category before reporting the results. The effect of the existing rating system is leaving a lot of probably excellent wines with poorer ratings than they deserve. An alternative approach is to try to improve the accuracy of the higher ratings, which can be facilitated by reducing the rater bias against the highest award. One study showed that it’s possible to improve reliability in college grade assignment through feedback Millet (2010). This method might work more generally for reducing rater bias."

    "text": "Humans often use consensus to assess knowledge. We might seek a second opinion for a diagnosis, ask around for restaurant recommendations, or look for online reviews of a product. Intiuitively, we put more weight on opinions that have more agreement. This chapter describes how agreement or disagreement can be quantified. These agreement statistics are restricted to situations where the assessments are made independently and where each subject is assessed at least twice. The combination of independence and repeatability are abbreviated in probability theory as “iid” for “independent and identically distributed.” This is a powerful assumption that allows us to reach strong conclusions. However, it is not always realistic.\nIn behavioral science, the focus of these statistics is on human observers who we’ll call “raters.” Raters assign “ratings” to “subjects.” This describes a familiar case like a product review with a five-star rating system. However, the same idea applies to any categorization task, like classifying images of cats and dogs, or diagnosing diseases from medical images. A fascinating example comes from an article in The Atlantic Magazine, here describing an analysis of a very old text called the Voynich manuscript.\n\nDavis magnified the handwriting, she noticed subtle variations. In certain places, the script was more cramped or more likely to slant as it crossed the page. She tested this observation by picking a letter that didn’t appear often and tracking it across the manuscript’s pages. Its style, she saw, varied among groups of pages but not within those groups. This suggested that the differences—larger or smaller loops, straighter or curvier crossbars, longer or shorter feet—were the product of different scribes rather than of one scribe writing the same letter in different ways.\n\nSee Davis’s paper for details1. For our purposes, the “raters” are scholars who categorize writing styles, the “subjects” are sections (folios) of the manuscript they are reviewing, and the presumed different scribes are the categories we generically refer to as “ratings.”\n\n\n\nTable 1: Selected rows from a table at the website for the manuscript: https://voynich.nu/index.html, comparing an early attempt to classify writing “hands” (Currier) to the recent classification (Davis). Hypothesized identity is unique to each column with the numbers denoting individual scribes.\n\n\n\n\n\nFolio(s)\nPrescott Currier\nLisa Fagin Davis\n\n\n\n\nf41, f48, f57r\n2\n5\n\n\nfRos (obverse)\n3\n2\n\n\nfRos (main)\n3\n4\n\n\nf87, f88, f93, 96\n4\n1\n\n\nf94, f95\n5\n3\n\n\nf103, f104, f106\nX\n3\n\n\nf105\nY\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Table 1 it’s recorded that Currier thought that the obverse and main folio fRos were in a single hand, whereas Davis has two scribes. Conversely, Davis has the last three rows as the same author while Currier has three. This is an example of how science works toward consensus by placing observations into categories. Agreements are good for pointing to what might be real, and disagreements are for honing or discarding theories.\nThe statistical question for data like this is to compare variation within groups to variation between groups. One application is an idea called “signal-to-noise ratio,” which is a measure of how much of the variation in the data is due to the thing we’re interested in (signal) versus how much is due to random variation (noise). In the manuscript example, the signal is the commonality of handwriting within contiguous sections, and the noise is variation within each section. Reliability of measures is the same idea in different clothing, where we might formulate reliability as between-subject variation divided by total variation. As an example, college grade averages (GPA) can have a reliability of about 0.8, meaning that 80% of the variation in grades is due to differences between students, and 20% is due to variation in how individual students earn grades. This makes GPA useful as a statistical measure, for example in predicting career outcomes.\nHow do we summarize a data set to sort signal from noise? This question involves a deeper question about the true categorization of subjects."

    "text": "It turns out that the questions “what is true?” and “what is knowledge, anyway?” are difficult to answer. There is a great body of work in epistemology, the philosophical study of knowledge, from which we can take a clever idea to get started.\nTo start, we have to imagine that “truth” exists. Since we are talking about classifications of subjects into one of two categories, we must commit to the idea that these categories (words that humans made up) might correspond to something in objective reality (whatever that is). We can easily make up descriptions that are fantasies, like unicorns or flying whales, and the goal is to have a way to distinguish these phantasms from real things like penguins and taxes. To do so, we have to imagine that by some mysterious means, our intellects and discourse can access Nature and name things.\nWords are slippery things, however. Although there are definitions, the real meaning of “pizza” is (ironically) ineffable; one could write volumes on the subject. Let’s take Platos’s definition of a man as a featherless biped. Our goal is a set of classifications “man” or “not man” generated from independent observers (we call them raters) who each inspect some objects in the world (we call them subjects) and assign “man” or “not man” to each. Then we’ll take that data and apply the between- and within-variance idea.\nTherefore the definition isn’t enough. We also need a procedure for generating the data the way we want. To ensure independence of raters, we don’t want them to collaborate on decisions, for example. In the sciences, procedures can be quite elaborate, as in detecting and classifying Higgs bosons, which requires a huge particle accelerator.\nThe story is that Diogneses the Cynic tossed a plucked chicken at Plato’s feet and declared “here’s your man.” The example drives a wedge between the definition “featherless biped” and what is actually meant by “man.” Outside of math and science, definitions and procedures are fuzzy in this way. Rater agreement statistics attempt to defuzz the ratings, to understand the reality behind them.\nHere’s where the idea from epistemology is key, because it gets to the nature of the fuzziness of classification. First we define knowledge as justified true belief (JTB), and then sort out where the fuzziness is.\nThere are three parts to JTB, and we already talked about truth; as a prerequisite we must believe that true statements can be made about the world, which means accessing something real and describing it. The third piece of JTB is belief, which we’ll take to be the classification assigned by a rater. If our rater looks at a horse and writes down “not unicorn,” we’ll assume that the classification represents what the rater believes. This runs into problems if we want to consider adversarial raters, like someone paid to rate consumer products, or an angry customer rating a service poorly for extraneous reasons. We won’t consider those possibilities here.\nThe first piece of JTB is where the fuzziness lives: justification. Outside of math, justification in words isn’t complete2. In the case of Diogenes versus Plato, an follower of the latter might reason that the plucked chicken meets the great philosopher’s definition, and therefore is a man. Others might use common sense to conclude that it’s not a man. There is more than one way to justify belief, but not all of them result in true classifications.\nThe JTB idea was dealt a blow by Gettier, who posed a number of examples where justification goes awry, but the idea is much older. Consider this example from Dharmottara in 779 AD3.\n\nA desert traveller is searching for water. He sees, in the valley ahead, a shimmering blue expanse. Unfortunately, it’s a mirage. But fortunately, when he reaches the spot where there appeared to be water, there actually is water, hidden under a rock. Did the traveller know, as he stood on the hilltop hallucinating, that there was water ahead?\n\nThe traveller had a belief that turned out to be true, but the justification was incorrect. The philosphers are concerned with whether or not this constitutes knowledge4, but we’re more interested in something simpler. That is to categorize the ways truth and belief can happen. If they don’t coincide (if we believe something false), then we’ll assume that the justification was incorrect. As the Gettier problems and the discussion they generated demonstrate, there are a lot of complicated ways in which justification can go awry.\nIn the literature of rater agreement, one can find similar language. In Aickin (1990), we find “The \\(\\alpha\\) agreement parameter is defined as the proportion of a population of items that are classified identically ‘for cause’ by two classifiers, the remaining items being classified at random […].” The author suggests that some subjects are more difficult to rate than others, which hints at modeling each subject’s probability of being in a category, in truth. This idea was explored in Dawid & Skene (1979), who also allowed that raters might have different proficiencies.\nAnother instance comes from the derivation of a rater agreement statistic called AC1 Gwet (2008). The author notes that “the assumption [is] that any rating that is not random will automatically lead to a correct classification, while a random rating leads to a correct classification with probability 1/2.” The idea is that we conceptually separate accurate ratings from random ones, which then means we must consider the probability distribution of the random ones. The random assignments will sometimes be correct, but for the wrong reason–just like the Gettier problems."

    "text": "Diagnosing illness is an important classification problem, and the simplest version is a blood test that returns a positive or negative result, perhaps scanning for an antibody. There are four possibilities, which can be organized into what is commonly called a confusion matrix. Suppose that we consider a statement S about the world, like “this patient has the flu.” Using a definition and process we reach a conclusion, so that we believe S to be true or false. This generates the classifications we’re interested in: this is what the raters do, generating lots of S or not-S data on cases.\nThe truth is often inaccessible, but recall that we assume that it exists, so that the statement really is true or false: each patient really does have the flu or does not. Here are the four possibilities:\n\n\n\nTable 2: Sample confusion matrix\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nS is true\nS is false\n\n\n\n\nBelieve S is true\nTrue positive cases\nFalse positive cases\n\n\nBelieve S is false.\nFalse negative cases\nTrue negative cases\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that there are four spots in the table where data can go: if we had perfect knowledge we could count the number of true positive cases, etc. If we converted these numbers to proportions by dividing by the table, we have three parameters left. This foreshadows what comes later: the heart of the classification problem (in its simple form) is a three-parameter problem5.\nThe limitation of casting the confusion matrix into a single-parameter statistic was noted by Cicchetti & Feinstein (1990), who suggested “two separate indexes of proportionate agreement in the observers’ positive and negative decisions. […] Why do we want a single index?” Another example comes from the motivation for the AC1 rater statistic Gwet (2008). It separately considers rater true positives and true negatives, but then assumes that these are identical for each rater, so that the result is a single parameter.\nAs a concrete illustration, consider the wine judging data used in Hodgson (2008). The first five rows look like this:\n\n\n\nTable 3: Wine ratings showing rows 1-5 of 183, taken from the study by Hodgson (personal communication).\n\n\n\n\n\nWine\nJ1\nJ2\nJ3\nJ4\n\n\n\n\n1\n3\n3\n3\n3\n\n\n2\n3\n3\n3\n3\n\n\n3\n3\n3\n2\n4\n\n\n4\n3\n4\n3\n1\n\n\n5\n4\n2\n1\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 1-4 scale is ordinal, meaning that we imagine quality to increase with the numerical value. For this discussion, we will reduce the scale to a binary classification: acceptable wine (ratings 2-4) or wine to avoid (rating 1). This simplifies the table to.\n\n\n\nTable 4: Simplified wine ratings, where 1 means “acceptable” and 0 means “avoid.”\n\n\n\n\n\nWine\nJ1\nJ2\nJ3\nJ4\n\n\n\n\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n\n\n2\n1\n1\n1\n1\n\n\n3\n1\n1\n0\n1\n\n\n4\n1\n1\n1\n0\n\n\n5\n1\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntuitively there is more reason to believe wines 1 and 2 are acceptable than with 3 or 4, for which one judge found them not metal-worthy. It seems safe to avoid wine 5, since all but one of the judges found it not to be metal-worthy.\nWe can put this information into the confusion matrix, but we’re missing information.\n\n\n\nTable 5: Confusion matrix for the first five wines, with missing information as question marks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntrue value of 2-4\ntrue value of 1\nTotal\n\n\n\n\nrating of 2-4\n?\n?\n15\n\n\nrating of 1\n?\n?\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is some awkwardness in imagining that the physical universe encompasses a reality including true wine ratings. It seems absurd on the face of it that the physical laws of the universe imply “wine science.” It’s useful to think of it in reverse: this reification of the ratings is a hypothesis that may be rejected by the statistics we derive from the data. If we find that raters are assigning ratings at random, there’s no evidence here for the reality of wine asthetics. On the other hand, strong indications of non-randomness need to be explained somehow.\nTaking the leap that all non-randomness is causal, and physical reality has a monopoly on causality, then something concrete in the world is behind the rating consistency. We could imagine the chemical similarities and differences of wines and their effects on human anatomy, and so on. Being “real” in this case doesn’t mean that the universe appreciates wine, only that the universe includes physical blobs called humans, and they have mechanical consistencies that correlate observations in this case. The confusion matrix is also used for calculating the causal effect of an experiment. In a medical context, the rows might be treatment categories and the columns patient outcomes. See Eubanks (2014) for more on that.\nBy using the rating counts for each subject instead of the total, we can–surprisingly–estimate the whole confusion matrix. We can even estimate the true classification values for each subject. For that level of detail see Chapter 4: Hierarchical Models."

    "text": "Signal and noise as variability between and variability within subjects translates into rater agreement within subjects versus between subjects. The usual way to turn this idea into a number is to count the number of actual agreements and divide by the total number possible.\n\n\n\nTable 6: Rater agreements count, showing the maximum agreements for N raters, the number matches that are evidence versus logical implications and the ratio of evidence to matches.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of raters\nMaximum agreements\nEvidentiary agreements\nImplied agreements\nEvidence / Maximum\n\n\n\n\n1\n0\n-\n-\n-\n\n\n2\n1\n1\n0\n1\n\n\n3\n3\n2\n1\n.67\n\n\n4\n6\n3\n3\n.5\n\n\n5\n10\n4\n6\n.4\n\n\nN\n\\(N(N-1)/2\\)\n\\(N-1\\)\n\\(N(N-1)/2 - N + 1\\)\n\\(2/N\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe maximum agreements in the table come from the combinatorics formula “N choose 2,” counting the number of possible pairs out of N. If a group of 5 people meet and all shake hands, it’s 10 handshakes. The number of pairs grow much more rapidly than the number of raters does6.\nThere’s a rule in thumb in statistics that it’s preferable to use standard deviation instead of variance when understanding the data. That’s because the units of standard deviation are the same as the original data, whereas the variance has squared units. The same effect is going on with counting agreement. In some sense, what we want looks more like the square root of agreement.\nIntuitively, three raters agreeing doesn’t seem like three times as much evidence as two agreeing. And if we look at where those agreements are coming from, most of them are purely logical. Agreement is transitive, meaning if A agrees with B and B agrees with C, then A agrees with C. This is a logical necessity, and it’s not evidence of anything. The Evidentiary and Implied columns of the table record the distinction between the two types of matches. As the number of raters \\(N\\) increases, the logically necessary agreements greatly outnumber the evidentiary ones, so the ratio in the last column of the table decreases toward zero.\nIf we only counted the evidentiary agreements, the maximum for \\(N\\) raters would be \\(N - 1\\), which is roughly proportional to the square root of the total number of agreements. We’ll come back to that idea later. However, the well-trodden path is to estimate the probability of agreement over all the subjects, which leads to the kappa statistics.\nFor the five wine ratings that are reduced to the binary category “avoid” or “don’t avoid” in Table 4, we can calculate the agreement as follows.\n\n\n\nTable 7: Agreement calculation for the first five wines, showing the maximum possible agreements, the actual agreements, and the agreement proportion out of the maximum.\n\n\n\n\n\nWine\nRaters\nPossible\nActual\nAgreement\n\n\n\n\n1\n4\n6\n6\n1\n\n\n2\n4\n6\n6\n1\n\n\n3\n4\n6\n3\n.5\n\n\n4\n4\n6\n3\n.5\n\n\n5\n4\n6\n3\n.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the fifth vintage in Table 7, there are more matches with the zeros than there are with the ones; both are counted. It is at this point what seemed like a good starting point begins to turn into a muddle, because since both the zeros and the ones can create agreement, how do we know what’s good enough agreement? What’s the worst agreement possible?\nA group of \\(n_1\\) raters who agree on the 1 ratings produces a number of agreements about proportional to \\(n_1^2\\), and similarly the \\(n_0\\) raters of 0 agreements produce about \\(n_0^2\\) agreements. Together that’s around \\(n_1^2 + n_0^2\\) agreements, which is less than or equal to \\((n_1 + n_0)^2\\), which is about the number of agreements if everyone agreed on a single category. So we get more agreement when everyone agrees than we do when the raters split into groups. That means that the least agreement happens when the raters are evenly split, giving us a floor for agreement.\n\n\n\nTable 8: Minimum rater agreement rates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of raters\nMaximum agreements\nMinimum agreements\nMinimum rate\n\n\n\n\n4\n6\n2\n.33\n\n\n6\n15\n6\n.40\n\n\n8\n28\n12\n.43\n\n\n10\n45\n20\n.44\n\n\neven N\n\\(N(N-1)/2\\)\n\\(N(N/2-1)/2\\)\n\\((N/2-1)/(N - )\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor six or more raters, there’s at least a 40% agreement rate, even when there’s the least possible amount of agreement. It’s annoying that the minimum rate of agreement changes with the number of raters. For real cases when we want to use these ideas, we might have different numbers of raters for different subjects, complicating an average minimum rate, which defines the worst case agreement."

    "text": "We saw in the previous section that the minimum frequency of agreement among raters is quite large, tending toward one half of the maximum possible. Whatever statistic we create as a measure of agreement needs to take that into account if we are to make sense of the results. We’ll get maximum agreement if all the raters choose the same category (of the two choices), and we’ll get minimum agreement if they split evenly between the categories, as if they each flipped a coin to decide. So there’s an association between worst-case random raters and the minimum agreement rate. This is the basis of the chance correction in the S statistic, which assumes coin-flipping raters as the worst-case benchmark from which to measure agreement.\nThe general formula for taking into account a worst-case (random) match rate \\(m_r\\) first computes the practical range of our scale, which is \\(1 - m_r\\), since the statistic can’t be less than \\(m_r\\). The amount of agreement observed \\(m_o\\) is then pinned to this scale as a “chance-corrected” match rate \\(\\kappa\\) (kappa) with\n\\[\\kappa = \\frac{m_o - m_r}{1 - m_r}\\]\nThe S statistic is a special case of this formula, where \\(m_r = .5\\). The sample of wine ratings can be used to illustrate. Recall that earlier we simplified the judges’ scale of “no medal” to “gold medal” to a binary classification between “no medal” (coded as zero) or “any medal” (coded as one). There were 30 maximum agreements among the four raters over the five wines (six per wine), and 21 actual agreements. The minimum is when the ratings are evenly split on each case, generating two agreements for each wine, or 10 total. An S-like statistic would be calculated like this:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nm_o &= 21/30 = .70 \\\\\nm_r &= 10/30 = .33 \\\\\n\\kappa_s &= \\frac{.70 - .33}{1 - .33} = .47\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]The kappa is now on a scale of zero (worse) to one (perfect agreement). Interpreting what the value means is difficult because it’s on the wrong scale as noted above. A value close to one half sounds mediocre, but not terrible, but we’re really looking for something like the square root of the agreement rate, which is .69. That value corresponds better to the intuition that the agreement in the table looks pretty good.\nThe coin-flipping assumption for randomness can be replaced with other assumptions. This has the effect of increasing the assumed worst-case agreement rate and hence decreasing kappa values. Perhaps the most popular choice is to reason that the raters are more likely to randomly pick the most common category so the coin should be weighted according to the rating distribution.\nFor example, the table of simplified wine ratings has 15 ratings of 1 and 5 of 0, or 75% 1-ratings. The worst case match rate is then the product of the proportions of 1 ratings, or \\(m_r = (.75)(.75) + (.25)(.25) = .625\\). This is the assumption of the Fleiss kappa. Note that the actual worst case match rate is still close to one half (because of the math), so it’s possible to get a negative Fleiss kappa if the assumption about the distribution of randomness fails.\nOne calculation under this proportionality assumption is:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nm_o &= 21/30 = .70 \\\\\nm_r &= .625 \\\\\n\\kappa_f &= \\frac{.70 - .625}{1 - .625} = .20\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]The actual calculations of these statistics are complicated by the choice of using exact combinatorical counts or long-run estimates. This distinction need not concern us in here.\nThe deflation of the rater agreement statistic in the Fleiss calculation above makes it clear that assumptions about random agreement are critical. A researcher may justifiably wonder which value is correct: are the wine judges in pretty good agreement, or is the judging mostly random? For historical reasons, rather than treating rater disagreement as a parameter to be discovered, the field has evolved to propose many variations of the kappa formula with different assumptions about the worst-case agreement rate.\nA limitation of most of the kappa statistics is that they make the simplifying assumption that a pair of raters reaches agreement randomly if both raters are random. This omits the possibility that one rater is accurate and the other isn’t."

    "text": "There are by now several statistics advertised as rater agreement statistics, including Cohen’s kappa, Fleiss’s kappa, Scott’s pi, Krippendorff’s alpha, S, and AC1. For convenience, these statistics will be referred to generically as “kappas.” Researchers who want a simple answer are faced with a bewildering set of options and claims about them. In Vach & Gerke (2023) we get a sense of the situation.\n\nGwet’s AC1 has been proposed as an alternative to Cohen’s kappa in evaluating the agreement between two binary ratings. This approach is becoming increasingly popular, and researchers have been criticized for still using Cohen’s kappa. However, a rigorous discussion of properties of Gwet’s AC1 is still missing.\n\nThe authors illustrate both the need for clarification and the faddishness that research communities can adopt when lacking real criteria. The kappas are ill-suited to answer such questions, and the proliferation of agreement statistics makes it difficult to compare results across studies or to know which one to use. Given pressures to publish results, there may be a tendency to use the statistic that gives the highest value, or to use the one that is most familiar. See Button et al. (2020) for a discussion of rater agreement statistics in the context of the “crisis in confidence in psychological research.”\nIt’s not just difficult to know what kappa to use, there are no meaningful guides to interpreting the results. “There is a wide distinction in the elucidation of Kappa values, and several efforts have been made to assign practical meaning to calculated Kappa values,” wrote the authors of Chaturvedi & Shweta (2015), who mention a widely-used heuristic found in Landis & Koch (1977) that proposed a translation between numerical values of kappa and qualitative descriptions of agreement, such as \\(\\kappa \\ge .81\\) is “almost perfect.” The categories are arbitrary, do not translate well between different agreement statistics (which can give different values for the same data) and their assumptions, and do not provide insight into how to improve ratings.\nThe agreement statistics for ratings have problems that should now be evident. The goal is to understand a three-dimensional relationship between ratings and true values, but the statistics are single parameters. A second parameter, the worst case baseline, is buried in an assumption, which varies by kappa, and is not tested for fit to the data. The result is a bewildering array of choices for rater agreement measures. As a result of this confusion, different cultures have emerged. If getting published is the goal, then higher agreement rates are more desirable, so a researcher can shop around for the “best” one.\nA research agenda was suggested in Landis & Koch (1977) that can be paraphrased as understanding (1) the true category of each subject, (2) the accuracy of raters, (3) truth and accuracy within sub-populations of subjects, (4) conditions that cause disagreement, and (5) what distinguishes “for cause” agreement and random agreement. Some of this can be accomplished by taking a fresh look at the kappas."

    "text": "The geyser of data produced in the information age has led to new methods of analyzing it that fall generally in the description of “machine learning (ML).” Assigning categories to subjects is a common task in machine learning, and the field has developed a number of methods to do so, including neural networks, support vector machines, and random forests. The goal is to assign categories to subjects in a way that generalizes to new subjects. The methods are often evaluated by comparing the predicted categories to the true categories, and the results are summarized in a confusion matrix. See Carpenter (2008) for a good example of this literature.\nIt may come as a surprise to both behavioral scientists and machine learning researchers that they seem to have independently worked on the rater agreement problem, since the two fields’ literatures don’t seem to overlap. Articles on rater agreement don’t cite machine learning papers, and vice versa. However, the two fields are working on the same problem: how to measure the accuracy of a categorization when we don’t have the true categories to reference.\nThere are differences in the methods and philosophies of the two cultures. The kappa approach is implicitly backward-looking, asking “how accurate were these ratings,” with the assumption that the measured accuracy (a kappa) will carry forward to future instances. The ML approach is more forward-looking, with a suite of tools like cross-validation and a vocabulary (bias-variance trade-off) to measure generalizability. As we have seen, the kappa approach is to reason out a plausible chance-correction calculation and use it to produce the single-parameter kappa. The ML approach is to estimate three parameters with regression models. Finally, the kappas are grounded in the psychology of human classification and come with philosophical links to epistemology, which I described earlier in Section 1.2. The ML algorithms are just statistics and code, barren of philosophical considerations.\nThe advantage of the ML approaches over the kappas is that the three parameter models avoid the confusions of the kappa zoo. But because they lack philosophical grounding, they run into an embarrassment of riches: three parameters is sometimes too many parameters for a model, so there can be multiple solutions. There are work-arounds, but it’s the same species of ad hoc reasoning that causes the problems of the kappa zoo. Fortunately, there’s a way to combine the best of both cultures to avoid most of these problems."

    "text": "We can now describe a regression model that allows us to estimate the four proportions that appear in the confusion matrix (see Section 1.3). Since the four cells sum to one, there are three free parameters to estimate.\n\n: Confusion matrix with entries to be filled in by the model estimates. The four numbers are proportions and sum to one, leaving three free parameters to estimate. C0 = class zero, and C1 = class one, standing in for any binary categories we might choose.\n\n\n\nTrue C1\nTrue C0\n\n\n\n\nClassified C1\n\n\n\n\nClassified C0\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo philosophical assumptions are needed to get started:\n\nThe classifications are real in the sense that true values exist.\nThe true values have a binary causal effect on the classification process.\n\nThese assumptions are provisional like hypothesis in statistics; the evidence will provide some support for the assumptions, ranging from no support at all to quite good. The reality of the truth values posed in assumption one is not like Plato’s cave shadows. In the case of wine judging, we can’t say there is a universal ideal for good wine, but if rater agreement is high we can say that some physical causal process exists for translating the observable subject (tasting the wine) into a category. So in that sense the category exists as part of the world. The translation is imperfect, because the conditions are not always perfect for the cause to happen, as with the Gettier problems7.\nThis may seem fiddly, but it gives us a place to start. For any given subject to be rated (e.g. object to be classified) we provisionally assume that there’s a latent truth value that we can never know, but might find evidence for. The second assumption then allows us to provisionally assume that the causal effect of the true value in the context of the classification process has the following nature:\n\nThe rater either assigns the correct class due to the causal pathway operating to connect the observation to the class (justified true knowledge), or\nSomething goes wrong with the causal pathway (the conditions weren’t quite right, etc.) and the classification is assigned non-causally, which is to say randomly.\n\nThe key to this is that the cause either works to connect the true value to the rater’s assigned value, or it fails completely. There’s no “partial cause.” When it fails, the rating is generated from a random process called a Bernoulli trial. It’s the simplest possible type of randomness, taking only two values with some fixed probability, like flipping a weighted coin.\nLet’s take inventory of the three parameters that come from the reasoning above.\n\nAmong the subjects being rated there is a fraction \\(t\\) that are in reality Class 1, with the remaining \\(1-t\\) being Class 0.\nAmong the ratings there is a fraction \\(a\\) that are accurate ratings (justified true knowledge) where the causal connection worked.\nFor the remaining \\(1-a\\) ratings, the causal connection failed, and there is some probability \\(p\\) that describes the frequency that they are assigned to Class 1. The remaining \\(1-p\\) are assigned Class 0.\n\nAll three of these parameters are proportions ranging from zero to one, and can be treated as probabilities that we estimate from appropriate regression models. Setting it up this way, instead of the usual machine learning parameterization avoids the most significant problem with non-identifiability (multiple solutions), which is class-switching. That happens when the model can fit the data, but is agnostic about which class is which, and so attempts to fit the model both ways at once.\nThe classification model with \\(t\\), \\(a\\), and \\(p\\) can be most easily understood in a tree diagram. For convenience, we’ll put a “bar” over a parameter name to indicate that it’s subtracted from one, e.g. \\(\\bar{t} = 1-t\\). This makes the notation more compact, and we always have \\(a + \\bar{a} = 1\\), etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: tap diagram\n\n\n\nThe diagram in Figure 1 shows probabilistic links between states of the world and rater classifications. The lowercase letters are probabilities (recall that the bar means subtract from one to make the complementary probability, so \\(\\bar{.2} = .8\\)). The upper case letters stand in for binary variables, with \\(T\\) being the (unknown) true classification, which is either Class 1 (\\(C_1\\)) or Class 0 (\\(C_0\\)). The raters assign classifications \\(C\\), which have hats on them to denote empirical assignments rather than true values. We read the tree top to bottom, hence the name for the model: t-a-p, an abbreviation of the tree structure.\nTo understand the model, consider a judge (the rater) tasting one of the wines (the subject at the top of the tree). We’re at the top of the tree, where there exists a true classification for the wine as either acceptable ((\\(C_1\\)) or unacceptable ((\\(C_0\\)). In the universe of wines the fraction of acceptable ones is \\(t\\), and for a given wine we can imagine a hidden variable \\(T\\) that records its true class. Suppose this one is acceptable, so that \\(T = C_1\\). That’s the set-up for the wine taster, who doesn’t know the value of \\(T\\), but is trying to ascertain it. If this assessment is accurate (a case of justified true belief), then we follow the left branch of the diagram again, and the judge’s classification \\(C\\) is assigned the value \\(\\hat{C_1}\\). The hat indicates that this is an empirical rating, so we can keep it distinct from \\(C_1\\), which is the true value. The accurate judgments happen with probability \\(a\\), and if it’s not accurate, the judge’s classification will be randomly determined. The rating will be assigned \\(\\hat{C_1}\\) with probability \\(p\\), and otherwise will get the \\(\\hat{C_0}\\) rating.\nIt’s important to note that the value of \\(T\\) is the same for any given wine. So when four judges all rate the same wine, they are all either on the left side of the diagram (if the wine is acceptable in reality) or on the right side (if not). The ratings are determined only by \\(a\\) and \\(p\\) at that point.\nFor a wine chosen at random, we can compute the probabilities of rater classifications. An acceptable wine will be classified accurately with a proportion of \\(ta\\), multiplying the probabilities along the leftmost edge from top to bottom. An inaccurate rating of \\(\\hat{C_1}\\) (acceptability) can come from either the left or right side of the diagram, and if we add those together we get \\(t\\bar{a}p + \\bar{t}\\bar{a}p\\), and since \\(t + \\bar{t} = 1\\) that expression reduces to \\(\\bar{a}p\\).\nAssuming we can estimate the three parameters from the data, we can then populate the confusion matrix by tracing the diagram down to each of the four outcomes, and multiplying probabilities as we go.\n\n\n\nTable 9: The t-a-p model’s correspondence to the confusion matrix. Terms in parentheses are inaccurate ratings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrue C1\nTrue C0\n\n\n\n\nClassified C1\n\\(ta + (t\\bar{a}p)\\)\n\\((\\bar{t}\\bar{a}p)\\)\n\n\nClassified C0\n\\((t\\bar{a}\\bar{p})\\)\n\\(\\bar{t}a + (\\bar{t}\\bar{a}\\bar{p})\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe entries in Table 9 demonstrate that if the t-a-p model fits the data and we are able to estimate the three parameters, it is a general answer to the rater agreement question. The later sections show how S, Fleiss kappa, and other statistics are special cases of t-a-p models."

    "text": "The sections above used five rows of the wine judging data for illustration. We now use the whole data set of 183 wines each rated by four judges to estimate the t-a-p parameters. The included app was used (see Chapter 7) for the analysis.\nThe binary classification illustrated above was to convert the original scale (1 = no medal, 2 = bronze, 3 = silver, 4 = gold medal) to a binary outcome where 1 = any medal (bronze, silver, gold), and 0 = no medal. We called the Class 1 category “acceptable.” Using the app to analyze that binary comparison we get the following output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Wine rating t-a-p analysis comparing C1 = ratings 1,2,3 (in-class) to C0 = rating 0.\n\n\n\nThe acceptable wines are the primary (in-) class, and the plot shows the distribution of ratings for acceptability. Since there are four judges, the possibilities are:\n\nNone of them could find the wine acceptable. This is the 0 at the left end of the plot. It happens for about 6% of the wines.\nAll four of them could find the wine acceptable. This is the 4 (four judges) at the right end of the plot. That happened for about 49% of the wines.\nSomething in between, where the judges disagree. In that case we can have from one to three ratings of “acceptable,” corresponding to those points on the plot.\n\nThe lollipops (black lines with dots on top) in Figure 2 show the empirical data straight out of the ratings. The dashed blue line is the model fit, showing what the distribution would be if the model were exactly correct. Here, “model” means applying the estimated parameters to generate the distribution.\nThe estimated parameters are found at the top of the plot:\n\n\\(t\\) = .73 estimates that 73% of wines are acceptable in reality. This is more than the rate of unanimous agreement, which we saw above was only 49%.\n\\(a\\) = .54 estimates that the judges make accurate ratings (justified true belief) more than half the time. The rest of the ratings are assumed to be random.\n\\(p\\) = .78 estimates that when random ratings are made, judges choose “acceptable” 78% of the time. Notice that this is close to the estimated actual rate of 73% (the estimated value of \\(t\\) above). This turns out to be a desirable quality in judges. See Chapter 3 for details, especially the section on the Fleiss kappa.\n\nNote that the randomness of inaccurate ratings is not a conscious choice of raters. They aren’t giving up and flipping a coin. They still have a reasonable basis for making a rating, and may be quite confident about it. The assumption is that something Gettier-like has gone wrong with the causal process that links the input (wine) to output (rating), which flips the process from deterministic to stochastic. As with any regression model, the world doesn’t have to actually be that way; it’s just an assumption to allow us to create the model. Then we check to see if the data matches the model. In this case, the data matches the model pretty well, as we can visually assess by comparing the blue dashed line to the lollipops. More formal tests of agreement will have to wait until later.\nThe wine ratings comprise four categories that are naturally ordered from 1 = “no medal” to 4 = “gold medal.” That kind of data is common: from surveys with Strongly Disagree to Strongly Agree scales, from consumer ratings, and many other sources. We humans seem to have a natural facility to think of descriptions along an imaginary intensity scale. This data type is called “ordinal,” meaning we can put the categories in order.\nThe t-a-p model is designed to work with binary data. It’s possible to switch to a multinomial model, but it’s common to analyze ordinal scales using binary distinctions. I’ll show how that works with the wine data. Along the 1,2,3,4 scale, there are three sequential cut-points where the commas are. The first one we can denote “1|2”, which splits the scores into two sets: an in-class {1} and and out-class {2,3,4}. This is the same thing as the Class 1 and Class 0 distinction from earlier. The second cut-point is at 2|3, splitting the data into ratings {1,2} and {3,4}. The plot shows the fraction of ratings in the in- and out-class for each cut-point.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Wine ratings divided into binary groups by cutpoint.\n\n\n\nThe 3|4 bar of the plot shows us that 88% of ratings are in {1,2,3}, so the remaining 12% are 4s (gold medal). As a validity check, there are 183 wines, each rated by four judges, so that should be 732 ratings. That looks like the height on the bars, so it checks out.\nFor a given cut-point, a wine rating will either be in the in-class or out-class This converts the scale to binary, and then we can estimate the model parameters. We repeat the t-a-p model for each cut-point to create a pattern like the one in the plot below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: t-a-p parameter estimates for ordinal scale based on cutpoints\n\n\n\nThe plot in Figure 4 shows each t-a-p parameter for each cut-point. As a reference, the Fleiss kappa estimates are also included as dotted lines. The significance of the Fleiss kappa is discussed later.\nThe accuracy parameter \\(a\\) at the top shows good accuracy for the lowest cut-point, meaning that the judges were good at distinguishing the least worthy wines from the rest. This is the case we analyzed earlier when we called the 1 rating unacceptable. As the quality rating increases, moving to the right on the top plot, accuracy decreases to less than half its value for the first cut-point (focus on the solid line). This would be the case if poor wines have more basis in physiology (sourness, etc.) and as the assessments become more aesthetic, they become more individualized and have less group agreement.\nThe second plot, showing estimates for \\(p\\) show the probability with which judges place a wine randomly into the in-class for inaccurate ratings. This will happen less often for the left-most cut-points, since accuracy is higher there. The dotted line is useful here: it shows what the \\(p\\) parameter would look like if the raters assigned ratings proportionally when making inaccurate classifications. For example, we noted earlier that 88% of the ratings are 1-3 (rightmost bar of the previous plot), so for the 3|4 cut-point, proportional random ratings would assign 88% of the inaccurate ratings into the {1,2,3} in-class. That’s where the dotted line is, at 88%. The actual parameter estimate (solid line) is at about 84%, meaning that judges are probably too conservative about assigning the gold medal category. Accuracy is low for the gold medals, and when the judges rate inaccurately, the ratings are slightly biased toward the lower ratings.\nThe bottom plot in Figure 4 estimates the true proportions for each cut-point, after taking into account the other two parameters. For the 3|4 cut-point on the right, it shows a proportion of {1,2,3} wines of about 65%. This is much lower than the 88% of ratings that are {1,2,3}. That’s the combined effect of inaccurate ratings at the top end of the scale combined with the bias toward lower ratings for inaccurate ratings. Looking at the two ends of the scale for the \\(t\\) plot, we can estimate that about 26% of wines are truly in the 1 = no medal category, and about 35% are in the 4 = gold medal category (1 - .65 = .35). That 35% figure comes from reading the estimated value of \\(t\\) at the 3|4 cut point, which is about 65%, and subtracting from one.\nIt’s possible to tell good wine from bad wine pretty reliably in this data set, but beyond that individual tastes may not be discerning enough to sort out four levels of wine quality. The scale could possibly be reduced to three ratings, or else keep the existing scale but collapse the 3 and 4 ratings into a single category before reporting the results. The effect of the existing rating system is leaving a lot of probably excellent wines with poorer ratings than they deserve. An alternative approach is to try to improve the accuracy of the higher ratings, which can be facilitated by reducing the rater bias against the highest award. One study showed that it’s possible to improve reliability in college grade assignment through feedback Millet (2010). This method might work more generally for reducing rater bias."

    "title": "Chapter 2: The t-a-p Model",
    "section": "",
    "text": "This chapter examines the assumptions and implications of the t-a-p model in detail to build a theoretical foundation for estimation and inference. This work also paves the way to connect the three parameter model to widely-used rater agreement statistics (kappas) and machine learning algorithms.\n\n1 Introduction\nSuppose that we have \\(N\\) subjects to be classified by at least two raters each, and each subject belongs (in truth) to one of two categories Class 1 or Class 0, abbreviated to \\(C_1, C_0\\). For example, if faculty members review portfolios of student work, the two classes could be “pass” and “fail.” We often use ordered classifications like “A, B, C, D, F” or “Excellent, Good, Fair, Poor” but these can be converted to binary classifications by grouping the classes. For example “A, B, C” could be compared to “D, F” or “Excellent, Good” could be compared to “Fair, Poor.” There are also extensions of the t-a-p model that work directly on ordinal or non-binary categorical scales. The exposition is easiest to understand for the binary case, so we will start there.\nWe assume that each subject is independently assigned to one of the two classes by each of \\(R\\) observers (raters). For now, think of \\(R\\) as fixed, so that there are \\(RN\\) total ratings, but that condition is relaxed later on, so that the number of ratings per subject can vary, which is common in real data.\nRater-assigned categories are distinguished from true classes in notation by the use of hats to suggest an estimated value. Ratings of Class 1 are denoted \\(\\widehat{C_1}\\), but some of them may be \\(C_0\\) in truth. This distinction between rated (estimated) values and true values leads to the idea of true/false positives/negatives and the confusion matrix described in the introductory chapter, reproduced here.\n\n\n\nTable 1: The t-a-p model’s correspondence to the confusion matrix. Terms in parentheses are inaccurate ratings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrue C1\nTrue C0\n\n\n\n\nClassified C1\n\\(ta + (t\\bar{a}p)\\)\n\\((\\bar{t}\\bar{a}p)\\)\n\n\nClassified C0\n\\((t\\bar{a}\\bar{p})\\)\n\\(\\bar{t}a + (\\bar{t}\\bar{a}\\bar{p})\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe true positive rate of classification in Table 1 can be separated into ratings that are true for a good reason and those that are accidentally true. This chapter expands on that idea to reveal other properties of the t-a-p model and how some existing rater agreement statistics are special cases of it.\nWe will assume that an assigned rating corresponds to the belief of a rater. This rules out raters who are intentionally being deceptive, for example. Then we will say that a rater makes an accurate assignment of \\(\\widehat{C_1}\\) or \\(\\widehat{C_0}\\) for a subject if\n\nthe rater-assigned class is the true class, and\nthe rater has justification for the choice.\n\nThese requirements operationalize the Justified True Belief (JTB) definition of knowledge used by philosophers who study epistemology. Inaccurate ratings are those where one of the two listed conditions fails. If the rater’s belief is false and chooses the wrong category or if they choose the correct category but because of an invalid justification. The latter case corresponds loosely to Gettier-type problems, where the chain of reasoning reaches a correct conclusion, but because of flaws in perception the logic isn’t sound. A clear case of failing the justification requirement is if raters flip coins to choose categories. Coin flipping is entirely random, but even good raters have some randomness inherent to the classifications. That randomness is the usual starting point for chance-corrected agreement statistics.\nThe rating process just described lends itself to a tree diagram that illustrates three variables as conditional probabilities: (1) the true Class 1 rate \\(t\\), (2) rater accuracy \\(a\\), and (3) the probability \\(p\\) of choosing \\(\\widehat{C_1}\\) when rating inaccurately. On the diagram, it’s convenient to use a bar over a variable to denote its complementary probability, e.g. \\(\\bar{a} = 1 - a\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Assumed rating process, where \\(T\\) is a hidden variable recording the true classification of each subject and \\(C\\) recorded the assigned class by a rater.\n\n\n\nEach rating is conditional on a subject’s true classification (Class 1 or Class 0), which will often be unknown, so that we can only observe the rater-assigned categories \\(\\widehat{C_1}\\) and \\(\\widehat{C_0}\\). The rating data will be denoted by \\(c_{ij}\\), where \\(i = 1 \\dots N\\) are the subjects and \\(j = 1 \\dots R\\) are the raters, who independently classify subjects as 1 or 0 according to the \\(\\widehat{C_1}\\) or \\(\\widehat{C_0}\\)assignment, respectively. This is convenient, since \\(k_i := \\sum_j c_{ij}\\) is the number of \\(\\widehat{C_1}\\) ratings for subject \\(i\\), and the average of the classifications made by raters is \\(\\text{E}[\\widehat{C_1}] = \\sum{c_{ij}}/(NR)\\).\nExample: A wine judge independently and honestly assesses a vintage for excellence. The two categories are \\(C_1\\) = “excellent” and \\(C_0\\) = “not excellent.” After judging four wines, the situation might be that in the table below.\n\nSample wine ratings showing normally unknown truth values.\n\n\nWine\nTruth\nAccurate?\nClassification\n\n\n\n\n1\nExcellent\nYes\nExcellent\n\n\n2\nExcellent\nNo\nNot Excellent\n\n\n3\nNot Excellent\nNo\nNot Excellent\n\n\n4\nNot Excellent\nYes\nNot Excellent\n\n\n5\nNot Excellent\nYes\nNot Excellent\n\n\n\nIf the judge makes an accurate assessment, the classification recorded matches the true value. But for the third wine, the judge got the correct answer even though the process was flawed and somewhat random (an inaccurate rating). For the second wine, the inaccuracy resulted in the wrong classification being assigned. Those two inaccurate cases are illustrated in the process diagram in the middle, marked Random.\n\n\n2 Conditional Probabilities\nThe tree diagram in figure Figure 1 models the assignments of ratings \\(c_{ij}\\) over subject \\(i\\) and rater \\(j\\), and can be read by multiplying the conditional probabilities on the edges from the top down to find the probability of a given classification being \\(c_{ij} = \\widehat{C_1}\\).\nIf a subject is not classified accurately, the classification for that rater is assumed to be made at random, with probability \\(p\\) of choosing \\(\\widehat{C_1}\\) regardless of the true class. So the conditional probability of a \\(\\widehat{C_1}\\) classification when the subject really is \\(C_1\\) is \\(\\text{Pr}(\\widehat{C_1} | C_1) = a + \\bar{a}p\\). Similarly, \\(\\text{Pr}(\\widehat{C_1} | C_0) = \\bar{a}p\\). This model assumes that guess rates for the two classes are the same independent of the true classification. More complex models are introduced later.\nThe binary (Bernoulli) probability that for a given subject with a given true classification, a rater will assign a \\(\\widehat{C_1}\\) rating is shown in the table below. This comes from reading the tree diagram from the top down, multiplying the branches.\n\nConditional probabilities of a single rater assigning a \\(\\widehat{C_1}\\) rating to a subject.\n\n\n\nTrue C1\nTrue C0\n\n\n\n\nClassified C1\n\\(a + \\bar{a}p\\)\n\\(\\bar{a}p\\)\n\n\n\nWe can use these probabilities to find the expected number of ratings of Class 1.\n\n\n3 Binomial Mixtures\nThe rating process posed in the t-a-p model is illustrated with the tree diagram and table of example ratings above. But both of those entail the use of the hidden true classification value for each subject. There are cases where that can be known, but in general it is not. What we usually have to work with is a table of ratings, from which we must infer the hidden variables like rater accuracy. The collection the ratings under the t-a-p assumptions fall into a well-studied probability distribution called a binomial mixture.\n\n\nCode\n# set the parameters\nN_r = 5    # number of raters for each subject \nN_s = 100  # number of subjects (not used here)\n\nt = .3 # fraction of subjects that are in fact class 1\na = .7 # probability of a rater rating a subject accurately\np = .2 # probability of a rater rating a subject as class 1 when rating inaccurately\n\n# find the conditional probabilities for each class\n\n  # probabilities of a class 1 rating for a class 0 subject\n  c0_probs = dbinom(0:N_r, N_r, prob = (1-a)*p)\n  \n  # probabilities of a class 1 rating for a class 1 subject\n  c1_probs = dbinom(0:N_r, N_r, prob = a + (1-a)*p)\n\n# create the mixture with t as the mixing parameter\nmixture = c0_probs * (1-t) + c1_probs * t\n\n# Plot the conditional probabilities\nplot(0:N_r, c0_probs, type=\"b\", col=\"blue\", pch=16, ylim=c(0, max(c(c0_probs, c1_probs, mixture))),\n     ylab=\"Probability\", xlab=\"Number of class 1 ratings for a given subject\", main=\"Binomial Mixture Plot\")\n\n# Add the second component (c1_probs)\nlines(0:N_r, c1_probs, type=\"b\", col=\"red\", pch=16)\n\n# Add the mixture as a black dashed line\nlines(0:N_r, mixture, type=\"b\", col=\"black\", lty=2, pch=16)\n\n# Add a legend\nlegend(\"topright\", legend=c(\"Class 0 Probabilities\", \"Class 1 Probabilities\", \"Mixture\"),\n       col=c(\"blue\", \"red\", \"black\"), lty=c(1, 1, 2), pch=16)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Binomial mixture showing the probability of the number of class 1 ratings for a given subject. In blue is the distribution for true-class 0 subjects, in red is the distribution for true-class 1 subjects, and the black line is the mixture based on relative proportions.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2 shows an example of how probabilities combine to create the mixture. Given the three t-a-p parameters plus the number of raters per subject, we apply the binomial probability density function using the probabilities found at the end of the previous section. The mixture is created by weighting these two distributions by their frequency in the sample space. In this case, the parameters are \\(t = .3\\), \\(a = .7\\), and \\(p = .2\\).\nFor true Class 1 cases, the probability of a rater assigning a \\(\\widehat{C_1}\\) rating is \\(ta + t\\bar{a}p\\), and for true Class 0 cases it is \\(\\bar{t}\\bar{a}p\\) (see the table at the end of the last section). Those are probabilities for a single rating. If we have \\(R\\) raters, then anywhere between zero and \\(R\\) of them could assign a \\(\\widehat{C_1}\\) rating to a given subject. The binomial distribution gives the probability for each of those possible count outcomes. For true Class 1 subjects the probability of \\(k\\) raters assigning a \\(\\widehat{C_1}\\) rating is\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nPr(k | C_1) &= \\binom{R}{k} (a + \\bar{a}p)^k (1 - a - \\bar{a}p)^{R - k} \\\\\n            &= \\binom{R}{k} (a + \\bar{a}p)^k (\\bar{a} - \\bar{a}p)^{R - k} \\\\\n            &= \\binom{R}{k} (a + \\bar{a}p)^k (\\bar{a} \\bar{p})^{R - k}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] That distribution is represented by the red line in Figure 2. Notice that the most outcome is that four of the five raters assign a \\(\\widehat{C_1}\\) rating. The reason that’s not five is that the parameter \\(p = .2\\) means that for inaccurate ratings, the “guess” is much more likely to assign \\(\\widehat{C_0}\\) than \\(\\widehat{C_1}\\). The effect is to deflate the number of \\(\\widehat{C_1}\\) ratings for true Class 1 subjects.\nFor true Class 0 cases (the blue line in the plot), it is\n\\[ Pr(k | C_0) = \\binom{R}{k} (\\bar{a}p)^k (1 - \\bar{a}p)^{R - k} \\]\nThese are the two probability distributions are shown in Figure 2, with the given parameters applied. The code is included so that you can try variations on your own.\nBut there are not necessarily the same number of true Class 1 and Class 0 cases. The fraction of Class 1 cases is assumed to be \\(t\\). The mixture of the two is\n\\[ Pr(k) = t \\binom{R}{k} (a + \\bar{a}p)^k (\\bar{a}\\bar{p})^{R - k} + \\bar{t} \\binom{R}{k} (\\bar{a}p)^k (1 - \\bar{a}p)^{R - k}.  \\tag{1}\\]\nThis is the mixture distribution that is assumed to represent the count data of Class 1 ratings per subject. To proceed with an investigation of the t-a-p model, we first count up the number of \\(\\widehat{C_1}\\) ratings for each subject. If there are the same number of raters for each subject, these counts will form a histogram that corresponds to the black dashed line in the figure, for some set of t-a-p parameters. The job then is to find out what those parameters are.\nFor a real data set, the red and blue plots in Figure 2 are assumed to exist, but are not directly accessible to us. Instead we can see something like the mixture (black dashed line). But even that isn’t exact, because it is subject to sampling error: the histogram of counts won’t exactly correspond to the ideal probabilities. The larger the number of subjects rated, the closer the empirical proportions will, in theory, converge to the ideal mixture distribution.\nFor general information on binomial mixtures of discrete data see Agresti (2003) chapter 14.\n\n\n4 Simulation\nThe interactive app provided with the tapModel R package allows you to specify t-a-p parameters and generate a data set from them. Once the package is installed, you can run the app with tapModel::launchApp(). Navigate to the Simulate Data tab.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Rating distributions with t = .3, a = .7, p = .2. Plot A has 20 subjects and Plot B has 1000. The blue bars are the histograms of the simulated data and the orange dashed line is the true mixture probability distribution.\n\n\n\nFigure 3 shows two count histograms with identical parameters except for the number of subjects (20 versus 1000). The histograms are the result of applying the t-a-p binomial mixture distribution with five raters on each subject and parameter set \\((t = .3, a = .7, p = .2)\\). Notice that the smaller sample size on the left (plot A) doesn’t match the distribution line as well as the one on the right. This is the effect of random sampling. The smaller the sample, the more likely it is that the empirical counts don’t look like the distribution.\nThis leaves us with two problems: how do we estimate the parameters, and how much should we trust the results? These are classical problems from statistics.\nThe accuracy rate \\(a\\) will affect the subject distributions. If \\(a = 0\\) the ratings will be distributed as \\(\\text{Bernoulli}(p)\\), independently of the subjects being rated. If \\(a=1\\), then all raters agree on the true value for each subject. Therefore the way we can reconstruct \\(a\\) from data is through the distribution of the within-subject ratings. The method used here can be seen as a latent class model with binomial mixture distributions. For a nice discussion of these ideas in practice see Grilli et al. (2015), which helpfully notes that binomial mixtures are statistically identifiable if the number of cases exceeds a low threshold McLachlan & Peel (2000).\nWe would like to know the true proportion \\(t\\) of the subjects belonging to \\(C_1\\) regardless of how they were rated, rater accuracy \\(a\\), and the proportion \\(p\\) of inaccurate assignments that are \\(\\widehat{C_1}\\). That goal describes the general model illustrated in the following section.\n\n\n5 Fitting the Model\nThe first question about the model illustrated in figure Figure 1 is whether it is computationally useful. Using known parameter values for \\(p, a, t\\) to generate simulated ratings, can we then recover the parameters from the data? The answer is yes, with some provisos. Given a data set \\(c_{ij}\\), we can fit a general model to estimate the three parameters \\(t\\), \\(a\\), and \\(p\\) using maximum likelihood to fit a binomial mixture model. The log likelihood function for the binomial mixture described by figure Figure 1 with \\(N\\) subjects and \\(R_i\\) raters for subject \\(i\\) is\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\ell(t,a,p;R_1, \\dots, R_N, k_1, \\dots,k_N) &= \\sum_{i = 1}^N \\log \\left( t\\binom{R_i}{k_i}(a + \\bar{a}p)^{k_i}(\\bar{a}\\bar{p})^{R_i-k_i} +  \\bar{t}\\binom{R_i}{k_i}(\\bar{a}p)^{k_i}(1-\\bar{a}p)^{R_i-k_i} \\right)  \\\\\n&= \\sum_{i = 1}^N \\log \\left( t\\text{binom}(R_i,k_i,a + \\bar{a}p) +  \\bar{t}\\text{binom}(R_u,k_u,\\bar{a}p) \\right)  \\\\\n&= \\sum_{u = 1}^{\\text{unique}(R_i,k_i)}n_u \\left[ \\log \\left( t\\text{binom}(R_i,k_i,a + \\bar{a}p) +  \\bar{t}\\text{binom}(R_u,k_u,\\bar{a}p) \\right)  \\right]\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{2}\\]\nwhere \\(k_i=\\sum_{j}C_{ij}\\) is the number of Class 1 ratings for subject \\(i\\). The sum over the logs is justified by the assumption that ratings are independent (i.e. multiplying probabilities). The \\(t\\) and \\(\\bar{t}\\) terms at the top of Equation 2 are the mixing proportions for the two classes.\nThe second equation in Equation 2 just rewrites the log-likelihood function more compactly to see the binomial mixture structure. The last equation is a more efficient way to calculate the likelihood, based on the observation that there are a limited number of pairs \\((R_i,k_i)\\) that can occur in the data. For example, if there are three raters for each subject, then the possible pairs are \\((4,0), (4,1), \\dots, (4,4)\\), five unique combinations regardless of the number of subjects \\(N\\). The likelihood is a sum over the unique pairs, multiplying each log-likelihood for that pair by the number of times it occurs in the data, denoted here by \\(n_u\\). In other words, the rating combination \\((R_u, k_u)\\) occurs \\(n_u\\) times. Using that formulation speeds up estimation algorithms because it reduces the number of calculations needed to fit the model.\nIt is straightforward to implement the function in the Bayesian programming language Stan Carpenter et al. (2017), using uniform \\((0,1)\\) priors for the three parameters (see the discussion section at the end of that paper to access the source code).\nTo test the computational feasibility of this method, ratings were simulated using a range of values of \\(t\\), \\(a\\), and \\(p\\). The 729 trials each simulated 300 subjects with five raters each, using all combinations of values ranging from .1 to .9 in increments of .1 for each of \\(t\\), \\(a\\), and \\(p\\). The Stan engine uses a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to gather representative samples from the joint probability density of the three parameters. Each run used 1,000 iterations (800 after warm-up) with four chains each.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Box and whisker plots show parameter estimates from simulations of rater data \\(t\\)-\\(a\\)-\\(p\\) values ranging from .1 to .9. The diagonal line marks perfect estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe accuracy measure \\(a\\) and the Class 1 “guess rate” \\(p\\) are stable across scenarios in figure Figure 4, but the estimated true fraction of Class 1 cases \\(t\\) is sensitive to values of \\(a\\) near zero. To see this, substitute \\(a = 0\\) into the likelihood function to get\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\ell(t,p;a = 0, k_1, \\dots,k_N) &= \\sum_{i = 1}^N t\\log \\left( \\binom{R}{k_i}p^{k_i}(\\bar{p})^{R-k_i} \\right)+ \\bar{t}\\log \\left(\\binom{R}{k_i}p^{k_i}(\\bar{p})^{R-k_i} \\right) \\\\\n&= \\sum_{i = 1}^N \\log \\left( \\binom{R}{k_i}p^{k_i}(1-p)^{R-k_i}  \\right).\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nSince the two terms at the top are the same, and we sum \\(t + \\bar{t} = 1\\), the \\(t\\) drops out of the formula. So \\(t\\) is under-determined when \\(a = 0\\), and we should expect poor behavior as \\(a\\) nears zero. This is intuitive: if the raters are only guessing, they should give us no information about the true Class 1 rate. If the data in figure Figure 4 are filtered to \\(a &gt; .2\\) the estimates of \\(t\\) greatly improve. Aside from extreme values of \\(a\\) affecting the estimation of \\(t\\), a visual inspection of the scatter plots of the parameter estimates shows no correlations.\nThe estimates in Figure 4 are taken from averages of the posterior parameter distributions, which is convenient, but sometimes hides the uncertainty in the estimates because of the limited range of possible values on [0,1]. When making inferences from a real data set, it’s useful to look at the full posterior distributions of the parameters to see if they are multi-modal or have other complications.\n\n\n6 Indentifiability\nBinomial mixtures are not always identifiable, meaning that the data don’t contain enough information to uniquely determine the parameters. If we fit two binomial distributions to the data with complete flexibility, each will have a “success rate” for the underlying Bernoulli trial, which determines the distribution’s mean and variance. There is also a weight parameter that defines the mixture; that determines the heights of the respective histograms of the two binomials. A simple data set would comprise the counts of Class 1 ratings for each subject. If the raters have reasonably high accuracy, a histogram of ratings will have a peak on the right, where a large fraction of raters of true Class 1 ratings agree. The average might be that 75 of 100 raters, on average agree that it’s Class 1. For true Class 0 cases, the raters might have an average of 25 of 100 ratings of Class 1 (erroneous ratings). The chapter on the interactive application shows how to simulate such data. It looks like this:\n\n\n\nSample ratings with 100 raters and 1000 subject, with high rating accuracy. It shows a clear separation of the two binomial distributions.\n\n\nIf we ask a generic optimization algorithm for the statistics to describe the two binomials, we can get two valid answers, e.g. distribution means of \\(\\mu_0 = 25\\) and \\(\\mu_1= 75\\) or \\(\\mu_0 = 75\\) and \\(\\mu_1 = 25\\). This is called “label-swapping,” because the solution doesn’t care which of the classes is which. One ad hoc solution is to include a restriction that the success rate for one of the distributions is greater than the other, but this is computationally awkward. The t-a-p model avoids this problem because the accuracy \\(a\\) is the non-negative difference between the means of the two binomials. In the example above, \\(a = .5 = (75-25)/100\\). Since \\(a\\) is bounded by 0 and 1, the model is generally identifiable.\nNon-identifiable cases do occur when one or more of the t-a-p parameters is zero or one. If \\(a = 1\\), it doesn’t matter what \\(p\\) is, for example. This can also cause problems when a parameter is close to one or zero. For an example of that, see Chapter 4: The Kappa Paradox. These issues can be investigated using Bayesian MCMC estimation, which provides a full posterior distribution for the parameters. The distribution may be multi-modal if there are two competing solutions. This gives us a way to detect degenerate solutions and look for a different model if desired. These degenerate cases aside, the tap parameterization of the binomial mixture has an advantage over generic optimization.\nWe can add more parameters to the basic t-a-p model. For example, we might split accuracy into Class 1 accuracy and Class 0 accuracy, as is illustrated in Chapter 4. These additions can lead to multiple solutions, which can often be detected from the MCMC distributions of parameters. This topic needs more development.\n\n\n7 Overdispersion\nThe basic t-a-p model assumes fixed averages of the three parameters over raters and subjects. The most sensible of these assumptions is that there is a single value for \\(t\\) that represents the fraction of Class 1 cases. That leaves two parameters that are certainly oversimplified in the tap model, so that counts of Class 1 ratings per subject are likely to have more variance than a binomial model would. This is due to anticipated variance in rater ability and the difficulty in rating subjects, resulting in overdispersion. A general approach to this problem is to allow each rater to have a different accuracy rate \\(a_j\\) and each subject to have a different guessing rate \\(p_i\\). This is a hierarchical model, which is described in Chapter 5: Hierarchical Models. Other approaches include using a beta-binomial prior for parameters, Williams (1975). Also see Ascari & Migliorati (2021). See Chapter 5 for more on these topics, particularly the discussion under the heading “Truth Parameters.”\n\n\n8 Other Properties\nAs is shown in Appendix A, rater accuracy \\(a\\) is proportional to the correlation between the true and assigned classifications. If \\(C\\) is the true classification and \\(T\\) is the assigned classification, then\n\\[ \\text{Cor}(T, C) = a\\frac{\\sigma_T}{\\sigma_C} \\]\nRelated properties can be found in the appendix.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nAgresti, A.

So the conditional probability of a \\(\\widehat{C_1}\\) classification when the subject really is \\(C_1\\) is \\(\\text{Pr}(\\widehat{C_1} | C_1) = a + a'p\\). Similarly, \\(\\text{Pr}(\\widehat{C_1} | C_0) = a'p\\). This model assumes that guess rates for the two classes are the same independent of the true classification.

    "text": "1.2 Binomial Mixtures\nThe rating process posed in the t-a-p model is illustrated with the tree diagram and table of example ratings above. But both of those entail the use of the hidden true classification value for each subject. There are cases where that can be known, but in general it is not. What we usually have to work with is a table of ratings, from which we must infer the hidden variables like rater accuracy. The collection the ratings under the t-a-p assumptions fall into a well-studied probability distribution called a binomial mixture.\n\n\nCode\n# set the parameters\nN_r = 5    # number of raters for each subject \nN_s = 100  # number of subjects (not used here)\n\nt = .5 # fraction of subjects that are in fact class 1\na = .7 # probability of a rater rating a subject accurately\np = .5 # probability of a rater rating a subject as class 1 when rating inaccurately\n\n# find the conditional probabilities for each class\n\n  # probabilities of a class 1 rating for a class 0 subject\n  c0_probs = dbinom(0:N_r, N_r, prob = (1-a)*p)\n  \n  # probabilities of a class 1 rating for a class 1 subject\n  c1_probs = dbinom(0:N_r, N_r, prob = a + (1-a)*p)\n\n# create the mixture with t as the mixing parameter\nmixture = c0_probs * (1-t) + c1_probs * t\n\n# Plot the conditional probabilities\nplot(0:N_r, c0_probs, type=\"b\", col=\"blue\", pch=16, ylim=c(0, max(c(c0_probs, c1_probs, mixture))),\n     ylab=\"Probability\", xlab=\"Number of class 1 ratings for a given subject\", main=\"Binomial Mixture Plot\")\n\n# Add the second component (c1_probs)\nlines(0:N_r, c1_probs, type=\"b\", col=\"red\", pch=16)\n\n# Add the mixture as a black dashed line\nlines(0:N_r, mixture, type=\"b\", col=\"black\", lty=2, pch=16)\n\n# Add a legend\nlegend(\"topright\", legend=c(\"Class 0 Probabilities\", \"Class 1 Probabilities\", \"Mixture\"),\n       col=c(\"blue\", \"red\", \"black\"), lty=c(1, 1, 2), pch=16)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Binomial mixture showing the probability of the number of class 1 ratings for a given subject. In blue is the distribution for true-class 0 subjects, in red is the distribution for true-class 1 subjects, and the black line is the mixture based on relative proportions.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2 shows an example of how probabilities combine to create the mixture. Given the three t-a-p parameters plus the number of raters per subject, we apply the binomial probability density function using the probabilities found at the end of the previous section. The mixture is created by weighting these two distributions by their frequency in the sample space.\nFor a real data set, the red and blue plots in Figure 2 are assumed to exist, but are not directly accessible to us. Instead we can see something like the mixture (black dashed line). Even that isn’t exact, because it is subject to sampling error. The larger the number of subjects rated, the closer the empirical proportions will, in theory, converge to the ideal mixture distribution. Our task is to disentangle the t-a-p parameters from that rating distribution so that we find the parameter set that best matches the data.\nThe interactive app provided with the kappaZoo R package allows you to specify the t-a-p parameters and generated data from them, and we’ll use that here to visualize what a binomial mixture looks like.\n\n\n\nRating distribution with t = .5, a = .7, and p = .5\n\n\nThe accuracy rate \\(a\\) will affect the subject distributions. If \\(a = 0\\) the ratings will be distributed as \\(\\text{Bernoulli}(p)\\), independently of the subjects being rated. If \\(a=1\\), then all raters agree on the true value for each subject. Therefore the way we can reconstruct \\(a\\) from data is through the distribution of the within-subject ratings. The method used here can be seen as a latent class model with binomial mixture distributions. For a nice discussion of these ideas in practice see , which helpfully notes that binomial mixtures are statistically identifiable if the number of cases exceeds a low threshold . More generally, see chapter 14 on mixture models for discrete data.\nWe would like to know the true proportion \\(t\\) of the subjects belonging to \\(C_1\\) regardless of how they were rated, rater accuracy \\(a\\), and the proportion \\(p\\) of inaccurate assignments that are \\(\\widehat{C_1}\\). That goal describes the general model illustrated in the following section. A hierarchical version is given subsequently.\nAs is shown in Appendix A, rater accuracy \\(a\\) is proportional to the correlation between the true and assigned classifications. If \\(C\\) is the true classification and \\(T\\) is the assigned classification, then\n\\[\n\\text{Cor}(T, C) = a\\frac{\\sigma_T}{\\sigma_C}\n\\]\nThe t-app model focuses on raters more than subjects. For example, some rater models include a difficulty parameter for each subject, assuming that some are harder to classify than others. The t-a-p model does not include this, per se, but a random-effects version of the model is introduced later that allows for subject-specific coefficients \\(p_i\\), which adjusts the guessing rate per subject when a classification is made inaccurately. See @paun2018comparing for a discussion of difficulty parameters in machine-learning models similar to tap.\nnote: see https://www.jarad.me/courses/stat544/slides/Ch05/Ch05a.pdf\nand https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mixtools/vignettes/mixtools.pdf\nhttps://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.01505\nI should address the label-switching problem. I think that’s taken care of by way the classifications are pre-specified, AND accuracy is generic."

    "section": "1.3 Overdispersion",
    "text": "1.3 Overdispersion\nThe tap model assumes fixed averages over raters and subjects for the three parameters. The most sensible of these assumptions is that there is a single value for \\(t\\) that represents the fraction of Class 1 cases, although this idea has been challenged by @???. That leaves two parameters that are certainly oversimplified in the tap model, so that counts of Class 1 ratings per subject are likely to have more variance than a binomial model would. This is due to anticipated variance in rater ability and the difficulty in rating subjects, resulting in overdispersion. A general approach to this problem is to allow each rater to have a different accuracy rate \\(a_j\\) and each subject to have a different guessing rate \\(p_i\\). This is the hierarchical model, which is described later.\nOriginal suggestion to use beta-binomial @williams1975394, modern look at it in @ascari2021new."

    "section": "1.4 Fitting the Model",
    "text": "1.4 Fitting the Model\nThe first question about the model illustrated in figure \\(\\ref{fig:tree}\\) is whether it is computationally useful. Using known parameter values for \\(p, a, t\\) to generate simulated ratings, can we then recover the parameters from the data? The answer is yes, with some provisos. Given a data set \\(c_{ij}\\), we can fit a general model to estimate the three parameters \\(t\\), \\(a\\), and \\(p\\) using maximum likelihood to fit a binomial mixture model. The log likelihood function for the binomial mixture described by figure \\(\\ref{fig:tree}\\) with \\(N\\) subjects and \\(R&gt;1\\) raters is\n\\[\n\\ell(t,a,p;k_1, \\dots,k_N) = \\sum_{i = 1}^N \\log \\left( t\\binom{R}{k_i}(a + a'p)^{k_i}(a'p')^{R-k_i} + t'\\binom{R}{k_i}(a'p)^{k_i}(1-a'p)^{R-k_i} \\right)  \n\\]\nwhere \\(k_i=\\sum_{j}C_{ij}\\) the number of Class 1 ratings for subject \\(i\\). The sum over the logs is justified by the assumption that ratings are independent. It is straightforward to implement the function in the Bayesian programming language Stan , using uniform \\((0,1)\\) priors for the three parameters (see the Discussion section to access the source code).\nTo test the computational feasibility of this method, ratings were simulated using a range of values of \\(t\\), \\(a\\), and \\(p\\). The 729 trials each simulated 300 subjects with five raters each, using all combinations of values ranging from .1 to .9 in increments of .1 for each of \\(t\\), \\(a\\), and \\(p\\). The Stan engine uses a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to gather representative samples from the joint probability density of the three parameters. Each run used 1,000 iterations (800 after warm-up) with four chains each.\n[need to cite @gelman2020bayesian and use those methods]\n\n\nCode\nregenerate = FALSE\n\nif(regenerate == TRUE){\n  param_grid &lt;- expand.grid(t = seq(.1,.9,.1),a = seq(.1,.9,.1),p = seq(.1,.9,.1))\n  \n  n_sims &lt;- nrow(param_grid)\n  N &lt;- 300 # number of subjects\n  R &lt;- 5   # number of raters\n  \n  out &lt;- data.frame()  \n  fixed_model_spec &lt;- stan_model(\"code/fixed_effects.stan\")\n  \n  for(i in 1:n_sims){\n    ratings &lt;- generate_ratings(N, R, param_grid$p[i], param_grid$a[i], param_grid$t[i])  \n    \n    # get the number of Class 1 ratings per subject in a vector\n    counts &lt;- ratings %&gt;% \n      group_by(SubjectID) %&gt;% \n      summarize(k = sum(RatedClass)) %&gt;% \n      select(k) %&gt;% \n      pull()\n    \n    kappa &lt;- sqrt(fleiss(counts,R))\n      \n    fixed_model &lt;- sampling(object = fixed_model_spec, \n                              data = list(N = N, R = R, S = 1, count = counts), \n                              iter = 1000,\n                              warmup = 200,\n                              thin = 1)\n      \n      stats &lt;- rbind( broom::tidy(fixed_model),\n                      data.frame(term = \"root kappa\",estimate = kappa, std.error = NA,\n                                 stringsAsFactors = FALSE)) %&gt;% \n                      mutate(p = param_grid$p[i], a = param_grid$a[i], t = param_grid$t[i])\n    \n      out &lt;- rbind(out,stats)\n    }\n    write_csv(out,\"data/fit_test_sim.csv\")\n} else {\n  out &lt;- read_csv(\"data/fit_test_sim.csv\")\n}\n\n# format for plotting\npdf &lt;- out %&gt;% \n#  filter(a &gt; .2) %&gt;% \n  select(parameter = term, value = estimate, actual_p = p, actual_a = a, actual_t = t) %&gt;% \n  spread(parameter, value) %&gt;% \n  rename(estimated_a = accuracy, estimated_p = p, kappa_a = `root kappa`, estimated_t = t) %&gt;% \n  mutate(Sim = row_number()) %&gt;% \n  gather(parameter, value, -Sim) %&gt;% \n  separate(parameter, into = c(\"type\",\"parameter\"), sep = \"_\") %&gt;% \n  spread(type, value)\n\n  ggplot(pdf, aes(x = actual, y = estimated, group = actual)) +\n    geom_boxplot() +\n    geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0) +\n    facet_grid(. ~ parameter) +\n    theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\nBox and whisker plots show parameter estimates from simulations of rater data \\(t\\)-\\(a\\)-\\(p\\) values ranging from .1 to .9.

To see this, substitute \\(a = 0\\) into the likelihood function to get\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\ell(t,p;a = 0, k_1, \\dots,k_N) &= \\sum_{i = 1}^N \\log \\left( t\\binom{R}{k_i}p^{k_i}(p')^{R-k_i} + t'\\binom{R}{k_i}p^{k_i}(p')^{R-k_i} \\right) \\\\\n&= \\sum_{i = 1}^N \\log \\left( \\binom{R}{k_i}p^{k_i}(1-p)^{R-k_i}  \\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nshowing that \\(t\\) is under-determined when \\(a = 0\\), and we should expect poor behavior as \\(a\\) nears zero. This is intuitive: if the raters are only guessing, they should give us no information about the true \\(C_1\\) rate. If the data in figure \\(\\ref{fig:tap_sim}\\) are filtered to \\(a &gt; .2\\) the estimates of \\(t\\) greatly improve. Aside from extreme values of \\(a\\) affecting the estimation of \\(t\\), a visual inspection of the scatter plots of the parameter estimates shows no correlations."

    "text": "In Chapter 4: The Kappa Paradox we saw how adding parameters can increase the explanatory power of t-a-p models. This technique can illuminate details that are hidden by averaging over cases. The Cohen Kappa is an prime example of this, where each rater has a different \\(p\\) probability of randomly assigning Class 1 for inaccurate ratings.\nThe enlargement of parameters can be expanded, for example to simultaneously estimate the accuracy of each rater and classification of subject individually. Such models are sometimes called hierarchical or random effects models or fixed effects models, depending on the research tradition (As noted in Agresti (2003), p. 523 and Gelman & Hill (2006), p. 245, fixed versus random effects are not good descriptions for Bayesian models). What these larger models have in common is that they allow for complex relationships of average and individual parameters, for example having a grand average accuracy parameter \\(a\\) in addition to individual accuracy parameters \\(a_j\\) for each rater \\(j\\). In a Bayesian context, we can do “partial pooling” by allowing the scale (standard deviation) of the \\(a_j\\) parameters to be estimated from the data, rather than fixed at a constant value. This allows the model to estimate the degree to which the raters are similar to each other, and to the grand average, which can increase likelihood, producing better model fit. For a nice introduction to Bayesian models, partial pooling, and related topics see McElreath (2020).\nIndividual rater parameters and subject truth values are of interest in many contexts. In educational psychology, we might want to know how well a teacher is able to assess student learning, and how well the students demonstrate knowledge or skill. In medical research, we might want to know how well a doctor is able to diagnose a disease, and how well the patients are responding to treatment. In machine learning, we may be concerned with the quality of training data drawn from human classifications. The ratings of consumer products on sites like Amazon or Yelp can be polluted with unfaithful reviews, so some means of detection is valuable.\nAllowing for each rater to have an accuracy parameter is straightforward matter of adding a parameter \\(a_j\\) for each rater \\(j\\). The truth value of each subject is more complicated, because unlike accuracy, we’re imagining that truth is binary. If we assume that each subject has a true classification of Class 1 (\\(T_i = 1\\)) or Class 0 (\\(T_i = 0\\): recall that capital letters for variables imply binary values), and each rater has an accuracy parameter \\(a_j\\). Finally, suppose the random assignment parameter \\(p\\) is treated as a nuisanse coefficient with a fixed scalar \\(p\\). Using the tree diagram, we can write the probability for rating Class 1 as \\(Pr[C_{ij} = 1] = T_ia_j + \\bar{a_j}p\\) and hence the complement is \\(Pr[C_{ij} = 0] = 1 - T_ia_j - \\bar{a_j}p\\). For independent observations, the log likelihood function \\(\\ell\\) can then be updated by summing over all the observations, with1\n\\[\n\\ell = -\\sum_{i,j} \\left[ C_{ij}\\log(T_ia_j + \\bar{a_j}p) + \\bar{C_{ij}}\\log(1 - T_ia_j - \\bar{a_j}p) \\right].\n\\tag{1}\\]\nAs noted above, capital letters are used for binary variables (zero or one) and lower case for scalar probabilities in \\([0,1]\\). The \\(C_{ij}\\) values are the observations (the data from the ratings), so that only one of the summands in the expression will be non-zero at a time, depending on whether the rating was Class 1 or Class 0. The \\(T_i\\) values are the unknown true classifications, which can only be 1 or 0, for Class 1 or Class 0."

    "text": "One way to retreat slightly from discrete truth values is to borrow an idea from the latent scale approach used in log-odds methods, and parameterize \\(t_i\\) as \\(t_i = \\tau(s_i)\\), where \\(s_i \\epsilon \\mathbb{R}\\) is a latent variable representing characteristics of the subject being observed and categorized, and \\(\\tau\\) is a thresholding function that very nearly maps \\(x\\) to \\(\\{0,1\\}\\) in a continous manner. A reasonable choice for \\(\\tau\\) is a sigmoid like the logistic function, \\(\\tau(s) = \\frac{1}{1+e^{-s}}\\), which has the property that \\(\\tau(s) \\rightarrow 0\\) as \\(s \\rightarrow -\\infty\\) and \\(\\tau(s) \\rightarrow 1\\) as \\(s \\rightarrow \\infty\\). One advantage of this approach is that we can build full regression models for the parameters, e.g. to incorporate subject-specific or rater-specific information as explanatory variables. In simulations, this approach can work, but the sigmoid operation significantly slows down convergence of the MCMC sampler.\nA second approach, which deserves more analysis, is to penalize the likelihood function with a term proportional to \\(\\sum{t_i(1-t_i)}\\). This is a crude way to encourage the sampler to find values of \\(t_i\\) that are close to 0 or 1, but not exactly 0 or 1. This also slows down computation significantly.\nThe third, most practical solution for simple indexing, where explanatory variables are not needed, is to first estimate the three-parameter \\(t\\)-\\(a\\)-\\(p\\) model and then use those estimates to recenter the indexed parameters of interest. In simulations, this worked very will in a fully-indexed \\(t_i\\)-\\(a_j\\)-\\(p_j\\) model, where \\(i\\) indexes subjects being classified and \\(j\\) indexes raters. But it is not clear that it will work in all cases.\nThe likelihood function for \\(t_i\\)-\\(a_j\\)-\\(p_j\\) can be expressed as the product of independent ratings, as\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{L}(a_j,t_i,p_j;c_{ij}) & = \\prod_{ij} \\left[ c_{ij}(\\tau(s_i)a_j+\\bar{a}_jp_j) + \\bar{c_{ij}}(1 -\\tau(s_i) a_j -\\bar{a}_jp_j) \\right]\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nwhere \\(t_i \\epsilon(0,1)\\) is the estimated probability that the \\(i\\)th case is Class 1, \\(a_j\\) is the estimated accuracy of the \\(j\\)th rater, and constant \\(c\\) is the known fraction of \\(\\overline{C}\\) ratings in the whole data set. The prior distributions of the parameters \\((\\t_i = \\tau(s_i),a_j,p_j)\\) are assumed to be uniform on \\((0,1)\\).\nTo interpret induced parameters in the context of the model in figure \\(\\ref{fig:tree}\\), a slight modification to the likelihood function is useful. The generative model in figure \\(\\ref{fig:tree}\\) is conditional on the true class being binary, not a probability between zero and one. This departure from the model is necessary computationally, so that the truth probability of each subject can smoothly evolve to maximize likelihood, but in practice, we’d like the values of \\(t_i\\) to be close to zero or one when computing likelihoods. This is accomplished using a soft threshold on \\(t_i\\) with a sigmoid \\(\\text{sig}_d(t) := 1/(1 + e^{-d(t-.5)})\\), where \\(d\\) is a discrimination parameter that adjusts steepness. The final likelihood function is\n\\[\n\\text{L}(a_j,t_i;c_{ij},P) = (-1)^{c_{ij}'}|a_j(\\text{sig}_d(t_i) -P)| + c_{ij}P + c_{ij}'P'. \\tag{3} \\label{eq:re_model}\n\\]\nInference of the \\(N + R\\) parameters maximizes likelihood using \\(\\eqref{eq:re_model}\\) assuming that each rating is independent of the others so that total probability is the product of the individual rating probabilities.\nTo test the model \\(N=1000\\) subjects with \\(R=5\\) raters each were simulated with a Class 1 rate of \\(p=.20\\), and with rater accuracies of .1, .3, .5, .7, and .9. The sigmoid discrimination parameter was set to \\(d=30\\). The model was specified in the Stan programming language, with four chains of 1000 iterations each, the first 200 being discarded as warm-up samples to control auto-correlation.\n\n\nCode\n# see code/plain model detail sim.R for details\n\nsim_summary_a &lt;- read_rds(\"data/sim_summary.rds\")\n\nsim_summary_a |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = as.factor(n_raters), y = mean_error,\n             ymin = mean_error - SE*2, \n             ymax = mean_error + SE*2,\n             group = `Number of subjects`,\n             linetype = `Number of subjects`)) +\n  geom_point(size = 2, position = position_dodge(.3)) +\n  geom_errorbar(position = position_dodge(.3),\n                width = .1) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  xlab(\"Number of Raters\") +\n  ylab(\"Error in Accuracy\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Estimates of individual rater accuracy with uniformly distributed t-a-p parameters indexed by rater and subject, with bars encompassing two standard deviations from the mean.

The estimated class probabilities \\(t_i\\) on the horizontal axis take into account estimated rater accuracy, which is imputed for each rater simultaneously. The distributions of posterior samples from the Stan output shows that the parameter estimates recapture individual rater accuracy from the simulated ratings. This does not happen without the soft threshold function to nudge the \\(t_i\\)s toward zero or one. For smaller data sets, the estimates become noisier. The estimates in figure \\(\\ref{fig:sim_truth2}\\) have only 100 subjects with three raters each, with randomly chosen accuracies. It shows much less certainty about the estimates.\nIf the model fits the data, the examples show it is possible to recover latent true class probabilities and individual rater accuracies, but a fairly large number of ratings are required to obtain small error bounds.\nIn addition to general models like \\(t\\)-\\(a\\)-\\(p\\), and the hierarchical model illustrated in this section, mixed effects models are straightforward to construct. For example, a \\(t\\)-\\(a_i\\)-\\(p\\) model can take individual rater accuracies into account when estimating \\(t\\) and \\(p\\). This will shrink the accuracy parameters toward their mean, so they are no longer usable as estimates for individual raters."

This is where we put the ratings in a sensible order, like “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree” for a common survey response, then consider each cut-point between these values. In the case of the wine ratings, we have:\n\nWine rating scale\n\n\nRating Value\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\n1\nNo medal\n\n\n2\nBronze medal\n\n\n3\nSilver medal\n\n\n4\nGold medal\n\n\n\nThere are three natural cut-points:\n\n1|2 divides the 1 ratings from higher ones\n2|3 divides the {1,2} ratings from the {3,4} ratings\n3|4 divides the {1,2,3} ratings from the 4 ratings.\n\nEach cut point defines a binary classification system, which we can estimate the t-a-p parameters for.\nTo use the built-in function for iterating over the cut-points, we need to prepare the data to be in a long format with only two columns SubjectID__ and rating.\n\n\nCode\n#' this will work for the data format where each rater has a column\nratings &lt;- wine %&gt;%\n  mutate(SubjectID__ = row_number()) |&gt; \n  gather(judge, rating, -SubjectID__) |&gt; \n  select(SubjectID__, rating)\n\nratings |&gt; \n  head(5) |&gt; \n  kable()\n\n\n\n\n\nSubjectID__\nrating\n\n\n\n\n1\n3\n\n\n2\n3\n\n\n3\n3\n\n\n4\n3\n\n\n5\n4\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we can apply the function to find estimates for the parameters at each cut-point as well as the Fleiss kappa statistics for each.\n\n\nCode\nparams &lt;- tapModel::get_ordinal_tap(ratings)\n\nkable(params, digits = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\nt\na\np\nll\ndegenerate\nCutPoint\ntype\n\n\n\n\n0.27\n0.54\n0.22\n-243.36\nFALSE\n1|2\nt-a-p\n\n\n0.24\n0.57\n0.24\n-243.47\nFALSE\n1|2\nFleiss\n\n\n0.54\n0.44\n0.59\n-286.12\nFALSE\n2|3\nt-a-p\n\n\n0.57\n0.44\n0.57\n-286.14\nFALSE\n2|3\nFleiss\n\n\n0.65\n0.25\n0.95\n-169.94\nFALSE\n3|4\nt-a-p\n\n\n0.88\n0.35\n0.88\n-170.82\nFALSE\n3|4\nFleiss\n\n\n\n\n\nHere’s how to plot the results.\n\n\nCode\nparams |&gt; \n  select(t,a,p,CutPoint, type) |&gt; \n  gather(param, value, t, a, p) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = CutPoint, y = value, color = type, group = type)) +\n    geom_line() +\n    geom_point() +\n    facet_wrap(. ~ param)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3 Bayesian Models\nBayesian estimation using Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) estimation methods are flexible in allowing for maximum likelihood estimation over any likelihood function you can imagine. This includes the standard t-a–p three-parameter model, but also includes hierarchical models where each subject is assigned a truth value and each rater is assigned an accuracy estimate. The tapModel package provides some limited interface to the most common of these models using library(cmdstanr). Installing that package entails some setup work. Please see the package documentation to install and test your installation before trying out the code below.\nThe use of Stan for Bayesian estimation is also included in the package, with an easy interface for three different models:\n\nt-a-p.stan, a three-parameter t-a-p model\nt-a0a1-p.stan, a four-parameter model that splits the accuracy parameter into \\(a0\\) and \\(a1\\), so that raters can have different accuracies depending on the true classification, and\nt-a0a1-p0p1.stan, a five-parameter version that expands the four-parameter version to also include \\(p0\\) and \\(p1\\), so the guessing probabilities are also conditional on the true classification.\n\nWe can use the counts data frame from the introduction to illustrate.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(cmdstanr)\nlibrary(LaplacesDemon) # for the Modes() function\n\n#' Get the .stan source code for the chosen model\nstan_model_source &lt;- system.file(\"stan/t-a-p.stan\", package = \"tapModel\")\n\n#' Compile it.

This is a limited version of the app that does not provide for Bayesian analysis. The full version of the app can be installed as a stand-alone R project from github. There are instructions there on installing it. To take advantage of the Bayesian estimation methods, you’ll need to install additional R packages and tools. The Bayesian estimation is done with a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) process of sampling from a probability distribution. For that, the Stan programming language is used, with the stancmdr package. That link has installation instructions. The library LaplacesDemon is also needed to compute the modes of distributions.\n\n\nThe simplest way to get started is with the tapModel library. It provides these functions:\n\nLoad data from comma-delimited value (CSV) files that are formatted as\n\nOutcome ratings in columns, where multiple traits have rating data, one subject per row, and multiple traits per subject. For example if a jury of reviewers rates a musical performance on style, technique, and musicality, each performer would have multiple rows, each with those three columns.\nRaters in columns, where the same type of jury data can be reformatted to have a Category column (style, technique, musicality), and each rater appears as a single column. In this format each subject only appears on a single row.\nLong format, where the subject ID, optional category, and rating appear as the three columns of the CSV.\n\nSimulate a data set by specifying the t-a-p parameters and sample sizes.\nEstimate t-a-p parameters from a (simulated or real) data set.\nEstimate ordinal t-a-p parameters from a data set. This assumes that the rating scale is sorted alphabetically in the correct order. For example, a numerical survey response scale is usually in the right order, but the labels may not be (“neutral” doesn’t sort in the middle of “strongly agree” and “strongly disagree”). You may need to adjust the rating labels accordingly, e.g. “1 - strongly disagree”, … “5 - strongly agree”.\n\n\n\n\nIf you launch the app from the github source code and have the stancmdr package installed, some additional features become available. These derive from using Bayesian modeling written in the Stan programming language to make parameter estimates from maximum likelihood models built to reflect variations of the t-a-p model. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are used to explore the model’s probability distribution, which you can then see within the app. This is advantageous because a parameter estimate may have a bimodal distribution when parameters are not cleanly identifiable. In those cases relying on an average for a parameter estimate is a mistake.\nAnother advantage of MCMC’s numerical simulation is that the basic t-a-p model can be extended to include more parameters without being rigidly tied to the binomial mixture model. Finally, the simple methods used for three-parameter estimation will fail when confronted with many parameters. In the interactive application, there is limited ability to add parameters. For complete flexibility, Stan scripts are provided in the chapter on hierarchical models.\nThe following sections describe the functionality of both the package app and the stand-alone version, with the latter’s additional features marked as “advanced.”"

The kappas vary in how they estimate the random match rates. For two ratings to match, two raters \\(j,k\\) of the same subject \\(i\\) must agree in their assignment of either Class 1 or Class 0 classifications. In other words, the binary random variables must agree: \\(C_{ij} = C_{ik}\\). A generic formula that includes the most common kappas is\n\\[\n\\kappa = \\frac{m_o - m_c}{1 - m_c},\n\\]where \\(m_o\\) is the observed proportion of agreements and \\(m_c\\) is the expected proportion of agreements under chance. The assumption about \\(m_c\\) is a defining feature of the various kappa statistics. The most general treatment of such statistics is the Krippendorff alpha (Krippendorff, 2018, pp. 221–250)\nThe various kappas differ in the assumption made about the chance correction probability \\(m_c\\). Commonly, the assumption is that \\(m_c = x^2 + \\bar{x}^2\\) for some probability \\(x\\). This simple formulation makes sense when both raters are guessing, but the actual case is more complicated because a match “by chance” could be a case where one rating was accurate and the other was a guess. This distinction isn’t generally made in the derivations of the kappas, although the AC1 paper discusses the issue, and hints at a full three-parameter model. It’s ironic that the confusion about kappas is disagreement about the probability of agreement by chance.\nThe Fleiss kappa (Fleiss, 1971) uses the fraction of Class 1 ratings \\(c\\) to create \\(m_c = c^2 + \\bar{c}^2\\). The S statistic (Bennett et al., 1954), also called the Guilfords’ G or G-index1 (Holley & Guilford, 1964), is a kappa that assumes \\(m_c = 1/2\\) when there are two categories. The AC1 kappa has a different form, assuming that \\(m_c = 2c\\bar{c}\\) (Gwet, 2008). The Cohen kappa is a variation where each rater gets a guessing distribution, so \\(m_c = x_1x_2 + \\bar{x_1}\\bar{x_2}\\) (Cohen, 1960). Because of the extra parameter, discussion of Cohen’s kappa is found in the chapter on hierarchical models rather than being included here.\nConsider two raters classifying an observation. In the t-a-p model we can express the expected value of observed matches \\(m_o\\) as the sum of three kinds of agreement: (1) \\(m_a\\) is when both raters are accurate (and hence agree), (2) \\(m_i\\) when both raters are inaccurate (guessing) and agree, and (3) \\(m_x\\) is the mixed case when one rater is accurate and the other is inaccurate but they agree. The second two of these have expressions that include the guessing rate \\(m_c\\). Following that thinking we have the following expectations for rates:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nm_a &= a^2 & \\text{(both accurate)}\\\\\nm_r &= p^2 + \\bar{p}^2 & \\text{(random ratings)}\\\\\nm_i &= \\bar{a}^2m_r = a^2m_r - 2am_r + m_r &\\text{(both inaccurate)}\\\\\nm_x &= 2a\\bar{a}(tp + \\bar{t}\\bar{p}) &\\text{(mixed accurate and inaccurate)}\\\\\nm_o &= m_a + m_i + m_x &\\text{(observed match rate)}\\\\\n    &= a^2+a^2m_r + m_r - 2am_r + 2a\\bar{a}(tp + \\bar{t}\\bar{p})\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{1}\\]\nFor \\(m_a\\), both ratings must be accurate, in which case they automatically agree. For \\(m_i\\), both must be inaccurate (probability \\(\\bar{a}^2\\)) and then match randomly (probability \\(m_r\\)). For \\(m_x\\), one rater must be accurate and the other inaccurate, in which case they agree if the accurate rater chooses the category that the inaccurate rater guesses. The various kappa derivations usually ignore these mixed matches in favor of using \\(m_r\\) as the chance match rate, which we called \\(m_c\\) in the kappa formula. This amounts to choosing \\(p\\) since \\(m_r = p^2 + \\bar{p}^2\\).\nThe various match rates in Equation 1 create a vocabulary for understanding some of the kappa statistics. The easiest one to analyze is the S-statistic (it is sometimes called the G-index)."

For \\(m_x\\), one rater must be accurate and the other inaccurate, in which case they agree if the accurate rater chooses the category that the inaccurate rater guesses.\nFollowing the intuition in the introduction that kappa is the square of what we are interested in, we can attempt to choose \\(m_c\\) so that \\(\\kappa = a^2\\) via \\(m_0 - m_c = a^2(1-m_c)\\).

In unsimplified form, the numerator of the equation above is the expected proportion of matches where there is at least one inaccurate rating, and the denominator is the the rate of non-perfect rating pairs, where at least one of the raters is inaccurate, and they may or may not match. The chance correction is therefore accounting for the accurate ratings by taking them out of the data altogether and then calculating inaccurate matches out of all rating pairs as the probability of by-chance matching.\nThe formulation of \\(m_c^*\\) isn’t directly helpful for computing a kappa because the whole point is to discover \\(a\\), so a formula for \\(m_c\\) that requires knowing \\(a\\) is circular. However, some special cases are of interest. For values of \\(a\\) close to zero, we have \\(m_c^* \\approx p^2 + \\bar{p}^2\\); when most ratings are random, the guessing parameter \\(p\\) is most important. When \\(a\\) is close to one, \\(m_c^* \\approx tp + \\bar{t}\\bar{p}\\); when most ratings are accurate, the inaccurate matches are likely to have only one inaccurate rating.\nIf \\(m_c^2\\) is averaged over a uniform distribution \\(p \\epsilon [0,1]\\), \\(t\\) also drops out so that the chance correction only depends on \\(a\\), the proportion of accurate ratings.\n\\[\n\\int_0^1 \\frac{\\bar{a}(p^2 + \\bar{p}^2)  + 2a(tp + \\bar{t}\\bar{p})}{1+a} dp = \\frac{a+2}{3+3a}.\n\\]\nIf when raters assign inaccurate ratings, if they at least conform to the distribution of true values, so that if \\(t = p\\), then \\(m_c^* = p^2 + \\bar{p}^2\\). We will call them “unbiased” raters when that happens. Finally, if \\(p = 1/2\\) then \\(m_c^*\\) simplifies to \\(1/2\\) as well. That condition will be referred to respectively as “naive” raters, as described below."

    "text": "2 The Fleiss Kappa: Proficient Raters\n[Note: in the asymptotic likelihood app, it seems that in addition to t = p, when p = .5 we have an accurate estimate of a as well–No, that’s only if we use p = .5, not c = .5.]\nThe Fleiss kappa is designed to work over multiple raters and a rating scale of arbitrary length. It assumes an asymptotic form for chance correction, so is most appropriate for large samples. We only consider the binary scale case here. Extension to larger scales is a topic in the discussion section at the end of this essay.\nThe baseline for random ratings for Fleiss is if we took all the observations and randomly shuffled them between subjects. This worse case has accuracy equal to zero, and the rating process devolves to\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nC_{ij} &= T_iA_{ij} + \\bar{A_{ij}}P_{ij} \\\\\n&= P_{ij}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThis is a simple binomial distribution with probability \\(p\\) , not a mixture of them, and \\(p = \\hat{c}\\) (the observed average fraction of Class 1 ratings) will have maximum likelihood over binomial models. In this case, we have no information about \\(t\\), and any value will do in the model, since it has no effect. The Fleiss kappa uses this random baseline and takes it one step further by assuming that the fraction of true Class 1 cases is the same as the reported fraction, as well, i.e. \\(t = \\hat{c}=p\\). The Fleiss kappa can therefore give poor estimates for \\(a\\) when the raters get the proportion of Class 1 cases wrong.\nFor example, consider a test for a medical condition that has a prevalence of 10%, but the test is in fact returning random results that are half positive and half negative. Then the kappa’s baseline for comparison is wrong, and the resulting estimate for accuracy will be biased.\nA review of the properties of Fleiss kappa can be found in , chapter 18, including kappa’s equivalence to an intraclass correlation coefficient, defined as ICC(1,1) in . In our notation here, the Fleiss kappa is defined as taking \\(m_c = \\hat{c}^2 + \\hat{\\bar{c}}^2\\), where \\(\\hat{c}\\) is the observed proportion of class 1 ratings. The Fleiss kappa is therefore a \\(\\hat{c}\\)-\\(a\\)-\\(\\hat{c}\\) model. The functional form \\(f(x) = x + x^2\\) for \\(x \\epsilon [0,1]\\) is parabolic, with a minimum at \\(x = 1/2\\), where \\(f(x) = 1/2\\) and maxima at \\(x = 0\\) and \\(x = 1\\), when \\(f(x) = 1\\). Therefore, the chance correction term \\(m_c\\) of the Fleiss kappa is opinionated, favoring larger rates of rater error. We would expect that the rater agreement statistic will tend to underestimate rater accuracy, taken to be \\(\\hat{a} = \\sqrt{\\kappa}\\).\nAs noted, the chance correction for Fleiss depends on the observed proportion of Class 1 ratings, \\(\\hat{c}\\). The expected value under the tap model assumptions is \\(E[\\hat{c}] = c = ta + p\\bar{a}\\); ratings of Class 1 result from either true and accurate ratings or from inaccurate ones that happen to guess Class 1.\nWhen \\(p = t\\), the expectation of ratings simplifies to \\(c = pa + p\\bar{a} = p\\). Intuitively, this case causes rater accuracy \\(a\\) to wash out of the observed rate of Class 1 ratings \\(\\hat{c}\\), so that the chance correction can be estimated directly. In the discussion of Equation 1, we saw that when \\(t = p\\), \\(m_c^* = p^2 + \\bar{p}^2\\). Therefore, the Fleiss kappa is equivalent to the chance correction that makes \\(E[\\kappa] = a^2\\) when \\(t = p\\). Under this assumption, when raters make inaccurate ratings, their ratings at least conform to the distribution of true values \\(t\\), and more generally the fraction \\(c\\) of Class 1 ratings is the true fraction. I’ll refer to that case “proficient” raters, since on average their work represents the true distribution of the data, which in the notation here is \\(t = c\\).\nUnder this \\(t = c\\) “proficiency” condition, rater accuracy \\(a\\) is the correlation between the raters’ ratings and the true classifications, \\(\\sqrt{E[\\kappa]} = a = cor(C, T)\\). Additionally, the Fleiss kappa is the intraclass correlation of the ratings. Derivations of these results are found in the appendices, where there is also an alternative derivation of the \\(a = \\sqrt{E[\\kappa}]\\) result.\nEven when \\(t \\ne p\\), when \\(a = 1\\), \\(\\kappa = 1\\), and when \\(a = 0\\), \\(\\kappa = 0\\) or is undefined.\nIn calculations over a grid of possible values for the input parameters in \\((0,1)\\) for each, the Fleiss kappa was rounded up to zero for negative values. When \\(t \\ne p\\), the bias away from \\(a^2\\) was often substantial (the R code to reproduce these results are in the supplementary materials).\n\n\nCode\ndf &lt;- kappa_error(1e6)\n\ndf |&gt; \n  group_by(t, a) |&gt;\n  summarize(error = mean(fleiss_a - a)) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = t, y = a, z = error)) +\n  geom_contour_filled(breaks = c(-1,-.2, -.1, -.05, 0,.05))  +\n  scale_fill_grey(start = .2, end = .8) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  guides(fill=guide_legend(title=\"Error\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The Fleiss kappa’s error in the estimate of rater accuracy averaging over expression(p epsilon [0,1]), taken over a dense grid of values in [0,1] for the parameters.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe average of the Fleiss kappa’s estimate of \\(a\\), shown in Figure 1, is pretty good when \\(t\\) is somewhere near .5, across the whole range of true \\(a\\) values. Problems occur for large and small values of \\(t\\). This result doesn’t hold for all values of \\(p\\), just the average. So if we have a large number of raters and imagine that their individual statistics \\(p_j\\) are randomly distributed, there’s some assurance that for reasonable values of \\(t\\), then \\(| \\sqrt{\\kappa_{fleiss}} - a | \\le .05.\\) Recall that under the proficient rater assumption (\\(p = t\\)), the expectation of this kappa is \\(a^2\\).\nAs a soft version of the proficient rater assumption, we can assume that the prior distribution of \\(p\\) is not uniform over \\([0,1]\\), but is represented by a beta distribution \\(\\beta(c_1, c_0)\\).\n[Note: see “decomposing a.rmd” for possible results connecting proficient raters to the decomposed accuracy models]\n[closed form for a exists under Fleiss assumptions, and we have t = p, so there’s a closed form for the likelihood given a data set]"

In terms of the t-a-p model, Gwet assumes that the probability of a by-chance agreement is \\(m_c = m_i + m_x\\), the sum of the cases where both raters make inaccurate ratings and the case where exactly one does.

In actual use, sampling error will be added to this. The Fleiss kappa has the least error overall. AC1 and S tend to overestimate \\(a\\), and The bias with the Fliess, S, and Cohen kappas come from their assumption that \\(D=0\\) in [equation], which derives from the assumption that the raters are either proficient (Fleiss) or naive (S). Cohen has the additional assumption about individual rater guessing parameters. If those conditions don’t hold in the data (i.e. if the model fit is poor), then rater accuracy will estimated with error depending on how large \\(D\\) actually is. For example, if \\(t = 0.2\\), \\(a = 0.2\\), and \\(p=0\\) (no one ever guesses \\(\\widehat{C_1}\\)), then neither of the kappa assumptions \\(p = 1/2\\) (S) or \\(t = p\\) (Fleiss) are close to true and \\(D = 0.2\\) instead of zero. The S estimate of \\(a\\) is .99 and the Fleiss estimate is .13.\nAlthough the two kappas surveyed can recover rater accuracy when the assumptions are met, they are not robust to large violations of those assumptions. The parameterized rater model presented here is a more general modeling approach to estimating rater accuracy and other parameters of interest.\nUnder the assumptions of the t-a-p model, each of the kappa statistics considered in this section add assumptions. For example, Fleiss adds the assumption \\(p = t\\). This has the effect of reducing the size of the parameter space. For a given data set, it’s then possible to assess the likelihood of each of the kappa choices by maximizing over the respective restricted parameter space. This can reveal which of the assumptions has maximum likelihood, if the desire is to choose between models. However, it’s probably better to not introduce such restrictions unless there’s a good reason to do so."

    "text": "2 The Fleiss Kappa: Unbiased Raters\nThe Fleiss kappa is designed to work over multiple raters and a rating scale of arbitrary length. It assumes an asymptotic form for chance correction, so is most appropriate for large samples. We only consider the binary scale case here. Extension to larger scales is a topic in the discussion section at the end of this essay.\nThe baseline for random ratings for Fleiss is if we took all the ratings and randomly shuffled them between subjects. This worse case has accuracy equal to zero, and the rating process devolves to\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nC_{ij} &= T_iA_{ij} + \\bar{A_{ij}}P_{ij} \\\\\n&= P_{ij}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThis is a simple binomial distribution with probability \\(p\\) , not a mixture of them, and \\(p = \\hat{c}\\) (the observed average fraction of Class 1 ratings) will have maximum likelihood over binomial models. In this case, we have no information about \\(t\\), and any value will do in the model, since it has no effect. The Fleiss kappa uses this random baseline and takes it one step further by assuming that the fraction of true Class 1 cases is the same as the reported fraction, as well, i.e. \\(t = \\hat{c}=p\\). The Fleiss kappa can therefore give poor estimates for \\(a\\) when the raters get the proportion of Class 1 cases wrong.\nFor example, consider a test for a medical condition that has a prevalence of 10%, but the test is in fact returning random results that are half positive and half negative. Then the kappa’s baseline for comparison is wrong, and the resulting estimate for accuracy will be biased.\nA review of the properties of Fleiss kappa can be found in Fleiss et al. (2013), chapter 18, including kappa’s equivalence to an intraclass correlation coefficient, defined as ICC(1,1) in Shrout & Fleiss (1979). In our notation here, the Fleiss kappa is defined as taking \\(m_c = \\hat{c}^2 + \\hat{\\bar{c}}^2\\), where \\(\\hat{c}\\) is the observed proportion of class 1 ratings. The Fleiss kappa is therefore a \\(\\hat{c}\\)-\\(a\\)-\\(\\hat{c}\\) model. The functional form \\(f(x) = x + x^2\\) for \\(x \\epsilon [0,1]\\) is parabolic, with a minimum at \\(x = 1/2\\), where \\(f(x) = 1/2\\) and maxima at \\(x = 0\\) and \\(x = 1\\), when \\(f(x) = 1\\). Therefore, the chance correction term \\(m_c\\) of the Fleiss kappa is opinionated, favoring larger rates of rater error. We would expect that the rater agreement statistic will tend to underestimate rater accuracy, taken to be \\(\\hat{a} = \\sqrt{\\kappa}\\).\nAs noted, the chance correction for Fleiss depends on the observed proportion of Class 1 ratings, \\(\\hat{c}\\). The expected value under the tap model assumptions is \\(E[\\hat{c}] = c = ta + p\\bar{a}\\); ratings of Class 1 result from either true and accurate ratings or from inaccurate ones that happen to guess Class 1.\nWhen \\(p = t\\), what we’re calling unbiased raters, the expectation of ratings simplifies to \\(c = pa + p\\bar{a} = p\\). Intuitively, this case causes rater accuracy \\(a\\) to wash out of the observed rate of Class 1 ratings \\(\\hat{c}\\), so that the chance correction can be estimated directly. In the discussion of Equation 2, we saw that when \\(t = p\\), \\(m_c^* = p^2 + \\bar{p}^2\\). Therefore, the Fleiss kappa is equivalent to the chance correction that makes \\(E[\\kappa] = a^2\\) when \\(t = p\\). Under this assumption, when raters make inaccurate ratings, their ratings at least conform to the distribution of true values \\(t\\), and more generally the fraction \\(c\\) of Class 1 ratings is the true fraction. I’ll refer to that case “unbiased” raters, since on average their work represents the true distribution of the data, which in the notation here is \\(t = c\\).\nUnder this \\(t = c\\) “unbiased” condition, rater accuracy \\(a\\) is the correlation between the raters’ ratings and the true classifications, \\(\\sqrt{E[\\kappa]} = a = cor(C, T)\\). Additionally, the Fleiss kappa is the intraclass correlation of the ratings. Derivations of these results are found in Appendix A, where there is also an alternative derivation of the \\(a = \\sqrt{E[\\kappa}]\\) result.\nEven when \\(t \\ne p\\), when \\(a = 1\\), \\(\\kappa = 1\\), and when \\(a = 0\\), \\(\\kappa = 0\\) or is undefined."

The guide will show you how to format a data set of ratings and fit a t-a-p model to the data.\nThere are data sets included in the package to use as examples. We’ll use the wine data set.

This is where we put the ratings in a sensible order, like “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree” for a common survey response, then consider each cut-point between these values. In the case of the wine ratings, we have:\n\nWine rating scale\n\n\nRating Value\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\n1\nNo medal\n\n\n2\nBronze medal\n\n\n3\nSilver medal\n\n\n4\nGold medal\n\n\n\nThere are three natural cut-points:\n\n1|2 divides the 1 ratings from higher ones\n2|3 divides the {1,2} ratings from the {3,4} ratings\n3|4 divides the {1,2,3} ratings from the 4 ratings.\n\nEach cut point defines a binary classification system, which we can estimate the t-a-p parameters for.\nTo use the built-in function for iterating over the cut-points, we need to prepare the data to be in a long format with only two columns SubjectID__ and rating.\n\n\nCode\n#' this will work for the data format where each rater has a column\nratings &lt;- wine %&gt;%\n  mutate(SubjectID__ = row_number()) |&gt; \n  gather(judge, rating, -SubjectID__) |&gt; \n  select(SubjectID__, rating)\n\nratings |&gt; \n  head(5) |&gt; \n  kable()\n\n\n\n\n\nSubjectID__\nrating\n\n\n\n\n1\n3\n\n\n2\n3\n\n\n3\n3\n\n\n4\n3\n\n\n5\n4\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we can apply the function to find estimates for the parameters at each cut-point as well as the Fleiss kappa statistics for each.\n\n\nCode\nparams &lt;- tapModel::get_ordinal_tap(ratings)\n\nkable(params, digits = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\nt\na\np\nll\ndegenerate\nCutPoint\ntype\n\n\n\n\n0.27\n0.54\n0.22\n-243.36\nFALSE\n1|2\nt-a-p\n\n\n0.24\n0.57\n0.24\n-243.47\nFALSE\n1|2\nFleiss\n\n\n0.54\n0.44\n0.59\n-286.12\nFALSE\n2|3\nt-a-p\n\n\n0.57\n0.44\n0.57\n-286.14\nFALSE\n2|3\nFleiss\n\n\n0.65\n0.25\n0.95\n-169.94\nFALSE\n3|4\nt-a-p\n\n\n0.88\n0.35\n0.88\n-170.82\nFALSE\n3|4\nFleiss\n\n\n\n\n\nHere’s how to plot the results.\n\n\nCode\nparams |&gt; \n  select(t,a,p,CutPoint, type) |&gt; \n  gather(param, value, t, a, p) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = CutPoint, y = value, color = type, group = type)) +\n    geom_line() +\n    geom_point() +\n    facet_wrap(. ~ param)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3 Bayesian Models\nBayesian estimation using Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) estimation methods are flexible in allowing for maximum likelihood estimation over any likelihood function you can imagine. This includes the standard t-a–p three-parameter model, but also includes hierarchical models where each subject is assigned a truth value and each rater is assigned an accuracy estimate. The tapModel package provides some limited interface to the most common of these models using library(cmdstanr). Installing that package entails some setup work. Please see the package documentation to install and test your installation before trying out the code below.\nThe use of Stan for Bayesian estimation is also included in the package, with an easy interface for three different models:\n\nt-a-p.stan, a three-parameter t-a-p model\nt-a0a1-p.stan, a four-parameter model that splits the accuracy parameter into \\(a0\\) and \\(a1\\), so that raters can have different accuracies depending on the true classification, and\nt-a0a1-p0p1.stan, a five-parameter version that expands the four-parameter version to also include \\(p0\\) and \\(p1\\), so the guessing probabilities are also conditional on the true classification.\n\nWe can use the counts data frame from the introduction to illustrate.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(cmdstanr)\nlibrary(LaplacesDemon) # for the Modes() function\n\n#' Get the .stan source code for the chosen model\nstan_model_source &lt;- system.file(\"stan/t-a-p.stan\", package = \"tapModel\")\n\n#' Compile it.

    "text": "1 Introduction\nProblems with chance-corrected agreement statistics have been studied for a long time, in particular when one class dominates the ratings (classifications). This would happen, for example, in a medical test for a rare condition, where most of the results would be negative. Non-intuitive results for kappa can result from such cases, a situation that has become known as the Kappa Paradox. See Bonett (2022) for one survey of such issues. Attempts have been made to modify the basic kappa formula to accommodate unbalanced classifications. In Byrt et al. (1993), observed agreement is adjusted for bias in rater tendencies (which would be the \\(p\\) parameter here) and for relative prevalence of classes. Krippendorff (2013),illustrates such a hypothetical case (page 484):\n\nSuppose an instrument manufacturer claims to have developed a test to diagnose a rare disease. Rare means that the probability of that disease in a population is small and to have enough cases in the sample, a large number of individuals need to be tested. […] Suppose two separate doctors administer the test to the same 1,000 individuals. Suppose each doctor finds one in 1,000 to have the disease and they agree in 998 cases on the outcome of the test.\n\nThe paradoxical result is that the Fliess kappa for this example is near zero, even though the raters agree on 99.8% of the cases. The reason is that the kappa is defined as the agreement rate minus the agreement rate expected by chance, and the expected agreement rate is very high due to the distribution of classes. Such unbalanced cases are common in practice, leading to the creation of new inter-rater measures like AC1 (Gwet, 2008) to attempt to accommodate this situation, but this solution has been criticized as well (Krippendorff, 2013).\nThe controversy can be summarized in the two points of view:\n\n(pro-kappa) the test has zero agreements on test-positive cases, and is therefore unreliable, therefore \\(\\kappa = 0\\) is correct, versus\n(anti-kappa) almost all the cases are in perfect agreement, therefore the test is reliable, and kappa should be near one.\n\nThe apparent problem can be usefully seen through the lens of the Fleiss kappa. If the baseline for comparison is randomly chosen pairs of ratings, any such set will be identical to the original data set in this case. Since the data is indistinguishable from randomness, the kappa, and hence accuracy should be zero. So in that sense the Fleiss kappa gives the correct result (kappa nearly zero). This conflicts with intuition in that there is a high level of raw agreement in the data.\nReliability statistics are generally concerned with two kinds of differences in ratings. Within subjects, if individual subjects are assigned ratings that don’t have much agreement, this is like measurement error. An ideal measure would return the same rating for the same subject every time. The other kind of difference is between subjects. There we want variation, because if all the subjects get the same rating, the scale doesn’t give us information. In the paradox example, there’s low variation within subjects (low measurement error), but very little variation between subjects, so the scale itself isn’t given us much information.\n\n\n2 Modeling the Paradox\nThe t-a-p model can illuinate this situation. If nearly all the ratings \\(C_{ij}\\) are one value, then the likelihood function over rating sums can be approximately reduced to the likelihood function over individual ratings given by\n\\[ \\text{L}(t,a,p;c_{ij}) \\approx a(t - p) + p \\tag{1}\\]\nso that \\(\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial t} = a\\), \\(\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial a} = t- p\\), and \\(\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial p} = 1 - a\\). Setting these to zero in the usual way to find the maximum, we obtain contradictory solutions to the likelihood maximization problem, since the first and last conditions imply that \\(a=0\\) and \\(a=1\\), respectively. Additionally \\(t = p\\) in Equation 1 requires that raters are unbiased. The contradictory solutions for rater accuracy \\(a\\) reflect the two “paradoxical” positions described above, and these show up empirically if we solve for the unconstrained parameters. The data are nearly under-determined with respect to the full t-a-p model, and the posterior estimate samples show prevarication.\nTo illustrate the dual nature of the maximum likelihood solution, he three-parameter t-a-p model was fitted to N = 1,000 samples with R = 2 (two raters). As described above, 998 of the subjects are assigned Class 0 (negative test result) by both raters, and for the remaining two cases they split, with one Class 1 and one Class 0 each.\n\n\nShow the code\nrefresh = FALSE \n\nif (refresh) {\n  \n  counts &lt;- data.frame(\n                 N_r = 2,\n                 N_c = c(rep(0,980),rep(1,2)))\n  \n  model &lt;- cmdstan_model(\"code/t-a-p.stan\")\n  draws &lt;- tapModel::fit_tap_model(counts, model)\n  write_rds(draws,\"data/Paradox_samples.RDS\")\n\n} else { # to save time\n  \n  draws &lt;- read_rds(\"data/Paradox_samples.RDS\")\n\n}\n\n# plot the draw densities\ndraws |&gt; \n  tapModel::extract_vars() |&gt; \n  tapModel::plot_draw_densities()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Results from a t-a-p model on the kappa paradox data, showing the density of estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo see the Stan code used to fit the Bayesian t-a-p model, click the button below.\n\n\nShow the code\n\n//\n//   Stan model specification for fixed rater a and no random effects\n//\n// Learn more about model development with Stan at:\n//\n//    http://mc-stan.org/users/interfaces/rstan.html\n//    https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started\n//\n\n\n// functions to make the code simpler below\nfunctions {\n  real p_true(real a, real s) {  // convenience function for binomial probability for \n    return a + (1.0-a)*s;        // subjects that are class 1 in reality\n  }\n  real p_false(real a, real s) {  // convenience function for binomial probability for\n    return (1.0-a)*s;            // subjects that are class 2 in reality\n  }\n  \n}\n\n// The ratings summary (number of 1-ratings per case) and descriptives\ndata {\n  int&lt;lower=0&gt; N;   // number of subjects\n  array[N] int&lt;lower=0&gt; R;   // number of raters fo a given subject\n  array[N] int count;  // count of ratings of category 1 for subject i\n}\n\n// The parameter to estimate\nparameters {\n  real&lt;lower=0, upper = 1&gt; a; // fixed for all raters\n  real&lt;lower=0, upper = 1&gt; p;        // guess rate for class 1 when inaccurate\n  real&lt;lower=0, upper = 1&gt; t;        // true class 1 rate\n}\n\n// The model to be estimated.

The plot for \\(a\\) shows a bimodal distribution of rater accuracy that slightly favors \\(a \\approx 0\\) over \\(a \\approx 1\\). Also in agreement with the analysis, the mode for \\(p - t\\) is nearly zero since both of those statistics are near zero. The \\(t \\approx 0\\) tells us that the modeled result is that there are very view Class 1 (test positive) cases.\nThe parameter estimates in Figure 1 point us to divergent interpretations of the severely unbalanced data: (1) the accuracy is about zero and the results are due almost entirely to random ratings combined with a severe test bias, or (2) the accuracy is high, but the prevalence of the condition is very small. These two conclusions correspond to the usual philosophical positions in the paradox’s discussion. The graphs in Figure 1 show usefulness of MCMC sampling, and serve as a caution against taking mean estimate values as meaningful without inspecting the distribution first.\n\n\n3 Divergent Accuracy\nThe MCMC estimation for the accuracy parameter vacillates between two poles, which leads to the idea to split Class 1 accuracy from Class 0 accuracy using two parameters for accuracy. This approach was suggested in Cicchetti & Feinstein (1990). It is a straightforward modification to the t-a-p model to bifurcate accuracy by using \\(a_1\\) for the true Class 1 branch of the probability diagram, and \\(a_0\\) for the Class 0 side.

The plots suggest high confidence that \\(a_0\\) is near 1, and somewhat less confidence that \\(a_1\\) is near zero. There is evidence that the accuracy of negative test results is high, but there is no evidence that the accuracy of positive test results is high. A scatterplot of the two parameters as drawn together from the posterior distributions shows that they cluster around the modes of the distributions in Figure 2. In other words, the induced model prefers the case when the accuracy of negative test results is high, but the accuracy of positive test results is low.\n\n\nShow the code\n# make a scatterplot of the two accuracy parameters\ndraws |&gt; \n  tapModel::extract_vars() |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = a1, y = a0)) +\n  stat_density_2d_filled(aes(fill = ..level..)) +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Scatterplot of the two accuracy parameters from the t-a0,a1-p model, showing that they converge to a high value of Class 0 accuracy and a low value of Class 1 accuracy.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe use of additional parameters to clarify the cases of unbalanced data can be expanded to accommodate a wide range of rater models.\nIt seems contradictory to say that we can classify Class 0 with confidence, but not Class 1, because these seem like two sides of the same coin. However, when there are many Class 0 cases, and only a few Class 1 cases, we could have 99% accuracy in true positives for Class 0 and nearly zero true positives for Class 1. One problem with the traditional kappa measures comes from condensing those two classification statistics into one.\n\n\n4 Individual \\(p\\) parameters\nWe could take this one step further and split \\(p\\) into two parameters that correspond to the two classes. In this t-a0,a1-p0,p1 case, we may get data sets that are not identifiable for label-switching reasons. That is, we may be able to find the maximum likelihood mixture of binomial distributions, but not know which is Class 0 and which is Class 1.\nWith the \\(a_0,a_1,p_0,p_1\\) parameters, label-switching means that we swap \\(\\bar{t}\\) for \\(t\\) and the two corresponding means swap as well. That requires some second set of the parameters \\(a_0',a_1',p_0',p_1'\\) such that\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\na_1 + \\bar{a_1}p_1 &= \\bar{a_0}'p_0' \\\\\na_1' + \\bar{a_1}'p_1' &= \\bar{a_0}p_0 \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{2}\\]\nIf Equation 2 holds, we can swap the primed parameters for the non-primes, and exchange \\(t\\) for \\(1-t\\), and the distribution is the same, with the same likelihood. There are four free parameters and two constraints shown above, plus the constraints that all parameters are in [0,1]. A example of a label-switching set is when \\(\\mu_0 = \\bar{a_0}p_0 &gt; a_1 + \\bar{a_1}p_1 = \\mu_1\\), so that there are more Class 1 ratings for Class 0 cases that there are for true Class 1 cases. Suppose \\(a_0 = .5\\), \\(a_1 = .2\\), \\(p_0 = .7\\), and \\(p_1 = .1\\). Then we have \\(\\mu_0 = (.5)(.7) = .35\\) and \\(\\mu_1 = .2 + (.8).1 = .28\\), so the mean of the Class 1 ratings is to the left of the mean of the Class 0 ratings.\nSuch situations point to poor quality data combined to too many parameters. For example, suppose the example above is wine tasting ratings, and it’s easier to for judges to agree on poor wine than excellent wine (this seems to be the case in practice). Suppose further that some of the raters are motivated to over-rate poor wines, pushing up the \\(p_0\\) rate to .7. This rating inflation makes the poor wines seem better than they are, and by comparison the good wines seem worse. From the data, we can’t tell which class is which under these model assumptions and with this data. However, the MCMC results will at least show us a multi-model distribution. In general, splitting the accuracy or randomness parameters should probably only be done for a specific reason, as with the paradox example, where we saw a bimodal distribution for accuracy.\n\n\n5 Estimating Parameters\nThe tapModel library and the advanced version of the interactive application can both be used to generate MCMC results from the t-a-p models expanded to include two \\(a\\) parameters and (optionally) two \\(p\\) parameters. There is an illustration of this in Chapter 8: The t-a-p App.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nBonett, D. G. (2022). Statistical inference for g-indices of agreement.

In those cases relying on an average for a parameter estimate is a mistake.\nAnother advantage of MCMC’s numerical simulation is that the basic t-a-p model can be extended to include more parameters without being rigidly tied to the binomial mixture model. Finally, the simple methods used for three-parameter estimation will fail when confronted with many parameters. In the interactive application, there is limited ability to add parameters.

    "text": "3.1 Exploring Binary Mixtures\nIf you’re starting to use the resources on this site to analyze real data sets, it’s a good idea to develop an intuition for the assumptions. The decision tree that starts with the true class, proceeds to accuracy and then randomness, results in a particular pattern of ratings: the collection of true Class 1 subject ratings will look different from the Class 0 collection as long as accuracy is greater than zero. On average, there should be more Class 1 ratings for true Class 1 subjects, and the gap between the average Class 1 and Class 0 ratings will increase as accuracy increases.\nTo see this effect, increase the sample size and number of raters (top two sliders) to the maximum, leave the rest of the sliders alone and generate the data.\n\n\n\nData with large number of raters and all parameters = .5\n\n\nThe table at the top of the display gives statistics for the model specification, which may vary from the actual samples if the Random option is chosen. These correpond to the statistics found in the Kappa chapter. The class proportions in the first row are the \\(c\\) and \\(\\bar{c}\\) statistics, the match rates are \\(a^2\\) and \\(\\bar{a}^2\\), and total match rate is the sum. These last two rows will be different calculations if individual accuracies are used. The random match rate is \\(m_r = p^2 + \\bar{p}^2\\) unless the individual parameters are used. The mixed rate is \\(m_x\\).\nThe shape of the rating distribution is a histogram of the counts per subject of Class 1 ratings per subject. The true Class 1 cases comprise the right bump, since accurate ratings add to the number for each subject half the time (since \\(a = .5\\)). On average, true Class 1 cases are receiving 75/100 ratings of Class 1. The true Class 0 cases–the left bump in the histogram–only ever receive inaccurate ratings of Class 1. The difference between the two peaks is 50, and that’s because 50 = .5(100), or rater accuracy times the number of raters. The more accurate the raters are, the further the two bumps will be apart.\nIf you dial in different specifications for the three parameters, you’ll quickly develop an intuition for how these models work. For example what happens if we leave everything the same, but change to \\(t = .8\\)? You should see that changing the truth parameter only increases the pile of Class 1 ratings; it doesn’t change where they are. This is the “mixture” parameter in the binomial mixture. We already know that \\(a\\) represents the average amount of Class 1 votes between the two bumps in the histogram, but trying out different values of \\(a\\) will allow you to visualize that.\nThe default settings of .5 mean that \\(t = p\\), the unbiased rater case (see the chapter on Kappa for more on that). If you change the sliders so that \\(t \\ne p\\), you can see the effect of bias on the rating distribution.\nFor all of these cases, you can switch to the next tab in the app (the one labeled “t-a-p”) to see if the solver can recover the correct values of the parameters you specified at data generation."

Any use of the full parameter set should be assumed to be non-identifiable, no matter where the class means lie.

    "text": "4.1 Interpreting Results\n\n\n\nModeled distribution (line) compared to empirical distribution (lollipops)\n\n\nThe top display after clicking Compute gives the estimates for the three parameters at the top of a plot. For the wine ratings with Class 1 = {1} and Class 0 = {2, 3, 4} is shown here. That choice is asking the question “how well can the judges distinguish the lowest quality wines from the rest?” The estimate is that 27% of the wines are actually Class 1 (a rating of 1), that rater accuracy is 54%, and that when random assignments are made, Class 1 is chosen 22% of the time. Since \\(t = .27\\) is close to \\(p = .22\\), the ratings are nearly unbiased in the sense discussed in the Kappa chapter.\nThe dashed line in the plot is the expected distribution of Class 1 ratings per subject. The vertical black lines with dots (lollipops) show the actual (empirical) distribution from the data. The extent to which these two agree is a measure of model fit. In this example, there are four raters for each subject (each wine), so there are a maximum of four ratings of Class 1 (the lowest quality rating of 1, as we specified with the selectors). The agreement between model and data looks better for the 0 and 1 counts than for the 2, 3, and 4 counts, implying that the model fit is better for higher ratings (Class 0).\nWe can separate the model’s distributions for the two classes by unchecking the box “show combined distribution.” The box “scale density by t” is checked as well.\n\n\n\nModeled distributions of the two classes\n\n\nThe outclass (Class 0) is modeled by the t-a-p coefficients with a spike at zero, meaning that by far the mostly likely number of Class 1 ratings in cases where the subject (the wine) is truly Class 0 is that no Class 1 ratings are assigned by the four raters. Translating that back to the original question, it means if the wine should, in truth, be rated as 2, 3, or 4 on the scale, it’s quite likely that all four wine judges will assign one of those ratings instead of a 1. In statistics notation, the spike at zero would be written as\n\\[\nPr[\\text{all wine ratings &gt; 1} | \\text{wine is actually 2, 3, or 4 quality}] = .48.\n\\]\nOn the other hand, if the wine is, in truth, a quality rating 1 wine, the ratings are not as unanimous. The most likely case is that three of the four judges will assign a 1 rating (what we’re calling Class 1, or in-class), and it’s a mound-shaped distribution rather than the spike as for Class 0.\nThe average rater accuracy is the difference between the averages for the two distributions shown, after dividing by the number of raters (4). Estimating from the plot, the mean of Class 0 is about .5, and the mean of Class 1 is about 2.7, for a difference of 2.2. Dividing by four gives .55, which is quite close to the numerical estimate of .54.\nIt sounds contradictory, but raters can be better at classifying Class 0 than Class 1, as it seems to be in this case. We could try splitting the accuracy parameter into two separate ones to improve model fit. This is described in the chapter on the Kappa Paradox.\n\n\n\nLikelihood trace for the t parameter\n\n\nThe second plot shows the shape of the log-likelihood for each of the parameters. It ranges over [0,1] for the selected parameter (here it’s \\(t\\)), while holding the other parameters constant at their estimated values (here it is \\(a= .54\\) and \\(p = .22\\)). The red marker shows the model estimate, which should be at the highest point on the graph. The green circle illustrates where the Fleiss kappa solution would be. That assumes unbiased raters (see the chapter on the kappas). Here, there’s not much bias, so the Fleiss kappa estimate is close to the optimal one.\nIf the MCMC results have been generated, the log-likelihood plot will be augmented with an illustration of the confidence interval around the mean value.\n\n\n\nMCMC results\n\n\nUsing the advanced features, a Bayesian estimate for each of the parameters is created, which gives more insights into the convergence properties of the parameter estimates. The top plot in the figure above shows the shading for the middle 5%, 50%, and 95% of the distribution shown in the bottom plot. The bottom plot gives the smoothed density function of the draws from the MCMC exploration of the likelihood space for this parameter. We want to see a normal-like (mound shaped) density, as is the case here. Sometimes this density is pushed up against the edge at zero or one, or can even be bimodal. In those cases, it is probably better to use a mode rather than the mean value for the estimate.\nThe dashed line in the plot is the average log likelihood for each of the values. Generally we’d like to see the peaks coincide."

    "section": "3.1 Binary Truth",
    "text": "3.1 Binary Truth\nSo far we have treated truth as a metaphysical property of each subject: we’ve assumed an unknown true classification for each subject. This assumption makes the general t-a-p model easy to analyze by using binomial mixtures because we only need to estimate the fraction of true Class 1 cases, not identify the true class of each case. Some binary mixture solvers do try to identify class membership, like Expectation-Maximization methods, and some Bayesian solvers can accommodate binary parameters, but Stan cannot.\nIn the derivation of the t-a-p model we used \\(T_i\\) to denote the true binary classification of subject \\(i\\), and \\(t\\) to denote the proportion of subjects that are Class 1, which is the average of all the \\(T_i\\) values. The \\(t\\) parameter became the mixture weight (a scalar) in the binomial mixture model. This presented no computational challenges, because each of the three parameters is a scalar in \\([0,1]\\), and the likelihood function is differentiable (smooth), which is a nice property for the solver algorithm to use to find the maximum likelihood.\nWith \\(N\\) subjects, there are \\(2^N\\) possible combinations of true class assignments, so exploring all combinations of them to find maximum likelihood is not feasible for even modestly sized \\(N\\). Moreover, the discrete nature of the binary truth parameters rules out solvers that depend on gradient descent, which maximize a function by exploring its smooth surface. This is a problem for many optimization algorithms (including Stan), which require smoothness to find a maximum value.\nThe combinatorial problem isn’t as bad as it looks for binomial mixtures. For a given number of raters and fixed \\(a\\) and \\(p\\) parameters, the likelihood function for the two class assignments is monotonic in the sense that there will be a cut point beyond which Class 1 is more likely than Class 0, and before the cut point Class 0 is more likely. The best guess for the true class for each subject depends only on the fraction of Class 1 ratings it receives, which is a much smaller dimension than \\(2^N\\). Intuitively, we could simply try all the cut points, optimize the \\(a\\) and \\(p\\) parameters for each choice, and identify the one with the maximum likelihood.\n\n\nCode\n#' Illustrate a t-a-p binomial mixture distribution of Class 1 Counts\na &lt;- .6\np &lt;- .3\npr_c0 &lt;- (1-a)*p \npr_c1 &lt;- a + pr_c0\n\ndistr &lt;- data.frame(N_c = 0:10) |&gt; \n           rowwise() |&gt; \n           mutate(Class0 = dbinom(N_c, 10, pr_c0),\n                  Class1 = dbinom(N_c, 10, pr_c1)) |&gt;\n           gather(Class, Probability, -N_c)\n\ndistr |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = N_c, y = Probability, color = Class)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_line() +\n  theme_bw() +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 0:10) +\n  xlab(\"Number of Class 1 Ratings out of 10\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Sample distribution of Class 1 ratings counts, with \\(a = .6\\) and \\(p=.3\\)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plot in Figure 2 illustrates the cut point idea. The x-axis shows the range of possible agreement between 10 raters, from none of them choosing to rate as Class 1 for a given subject to unanimity among all ten that the subject is Class 1. The two curves show the probabilities for each of the true classes under the t-a-p assumptions. It’s more likely that true Class 1 cases will receive a majority of Class 1 ratings. In fact, true Class 1 cases are slightly more likely to receive four ratings of Class 1 than are true Class 0 cases (the blue marker is slightly higher than the red one at four on the axis). We could then set a rule that if a subject receives fewer than four ratings of Class 1, it is probably Class 0, and otherwise it’s probably Class 1. For any accuracy greater than zero there will be such a cut point.\nThis approach to classifying the true class of cases is necessarily crude, because we don’t have enough information to accurately assign a binary \\(t_i\\) to each case. However, the cut off method may be used after the three t-a-p parameters are estimated, to classify the cases for some use. For example a college may review portfolios of student writing and have three independent readers rate each portfolio as Pass or Fail. To reach a decision, it’s reasonable to pick a cut point, e.g. two of the three raters must rate Pass to accept the portfolio.\nAs an estimation method, the cut point process distorts the likelihood function due to the truncation where the two binomial distributions overlap.\n\n\nCode\n#' Illustrate a t-a-p binomial mixture distribution of Class 1 Counts\na &lt;- .4\np &lt;- .4\npr_c0 &lt;- (1-a)*p \npr_c1 &lt;- a + pr_c0\n\ndistr &lt;- data.frame(N_c = 0:10) |&gt; \n           rowwise() |&gt; \n           mutate(C0 = dbinom(N_c, 10, pr_c0),\n                  C1 = dbinom(N_c, 10, pr_c1),\n                  # apply the cut point \n                  C0_cp = if_else(C0 &gt; C1, C0 + C1, NA),\n                  C1_cp = if_else(C1 &gt; C0, C0 + C1, NA)) |&gt;\n           gather(Class, Probability, -N_c) |&gt; \n           separate(Class, into = c(\"Class\",\"Type\"), sep = \"_\") |&gt; \n           replace_na(list(Type = \"original\"))\n\ndistr |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = N_c, y = Probability, color = Class, linetype = Type)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_line() +\n  theme_bw() +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 0:10) +\n  xlab(\"Number of Class 1 Ratings out of 10\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Sample distribution of Class 1 ratings counts, with \\(a = .4\\) and \\(p=.4\\) after a cut point is applied at 4.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe distributions in Figure 3 show the distorting effect of applying a cut point at four ratings of Class 1 with \\(a = p = .4\\). The original distributions are shown in the dashed lines, and the cut point distributions are shown in the solid lines. The cut point process distorts the likelihood function due to the truncation where the two binomial distributions overlap. The cut point process is a form of data reduction, and it can be useful for some purposes, but it’s flawed way to estimate the true class of each case.\nThere are two ways to proceed here. If the use of the ratings is ultimately to apply a cut point to administratively determine the class of each subject, then we could modify the t-a-p model assumptions and solvers to optimize over the truncated distributions shown as solid lines in Figure 3. The problem will be to optimize over a discontinuous function, since the likelihood function will have a jump at the cut point. This is a difficult problem for most optimization algorithms, which depend on smoothness to find a maximum.\nThe other approach is to give up on the idea of estimating binary truth values and to allow the individual parameters to be probabilities instead. This preserves the smoothness of the likelihood function, and allows the use of gradient descent algorithms to find the maximum likelihood. One such method is to average out (marginalize) truth values over the ratings for a subject. That idea is outlined in Team (2022), section 1.10 and implemented in several algorithms found in Carpenter (2008). See Chapter 6: Machine Learning Methods for more on those."

    "text": "4.1 Latent Truth\nSince likelihood is maximized for binary truth, we can take a middle ground and use scalar truth parameters, but use a transformation to nudge the values toward zero or one. One such approach is to use a threshold function, as is used in logistic regression, neural nets, and so forth. This corresponds to the idea from psychological measurement, where a “latent” variable is allowed to have real values, usually with a normal distribution centered at zero, but the value is not directly observed or measured. For example, we might imagine that college students have an abstract trait of “writing ability” that is approximately normally distributed over the universe of students. We then convert from the latent scale to a quasi-discrete one by applying a threshold function \\(\\tau\\) like the logistic function. For example, \\(\\tau(s) = 1/(1+e^{-\\lambda s})\\) has the property that \\(\\tau(0) = 1/2\\) , \\(\\tau(s) \\rightarrow 0\\) as \\(s \\rightarrow -\\infty\\) and \\(\\tau(s) \\rightarrow 1\\) as \\(s \\rightarrow \\infty\\). The steepness of the transition from zero to one (the thresholding) can be adjusted via the parameter \\(\\lambda\\), which can be used in conjunction with the scale (standard deviation) of the distribution used as a prior for the latent variable in a Bayesian analysis.\n\n\nCode\n#' plot the logistic function from [-5,5] with three different thresholding constants \n\ndf &lt;- expand.grid(x = seq(-5,5,.1), lambda = c(1,2,.5)) |&gt; \n      mutate(y = 1/(1+exp(-lambda*x)))\n\ndf |&gt;  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y, color = as.factor(lambda))) +   \n       geom_line(linewidth = 1) +   \n       theme_bw() +   \n       xlab(\"s\") +   \n       ylab(\"tau(s)\") +   \n       scale_color_discrete(name = \"scaling\\nparameter\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: The logistic function, \\(\\tau(s) = 1/(1+e^{-cs})\\), with \\(c = 1, 2, .5\\).\n\n\n\n\n\nUse of the threshold function (sometimes called a sigma function because it looks like an S) with a restrictive prior distribution constrains the domain of the latent variables for computational efficiency. This arrangement allows the truth parameters to take any real value, and the log likelihood function to be differentiable, but it approximates a discrete truth value because applying the transformation forces the values toward zero or one. The modification to the likelihood function is straightforward, with\n\\[ \\ell = -\\sum_{i,j} \\left[ C_{ij}\\log(\\tau_i(s)a_j + \\bar{a_j}p) + \\bar{C_{ij}}\\log(1 - \\tau_i(s)a_j - \\bar{a_j}p) \\right]. \\]\nHere, the \\(\\tau(s)\\) thresholding function has a scaling parameter applied to control the steepness. This approach is similar to item response theory or Rasch models. One advantage of this approach is that it’s possible to include predictor variables in the model, for example to estimate the effect of a rater’s experience (e.g. age, number of ratings) on their accuracy.\n\n\nCode\nrefresh = FALSE \n\nif(refresh){    \n     stan_model_source &lt;- system.file(\"stan/t_i-a-p soft_step.stan\", package = \"tapModel\")      \n     #' Compile it.

In my limited attempts with this idea, there has not been enough selective pressure on the parameter to matter. This is a possible area of future research.\n##Expectation-Maximization\nThe Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is a general method for estimating parameters in models with latent variables. The EM algorithm is a two-step process, where the E-step computes the expected value of unobserved parameters (“latent” variables) given current estimates for “fixed” parameters, and the M-step updates the parameter estimates given the expected values of the latent variables. In the case of individualized \\(t_i\\) parameters, we’d make some estimation of those with fixed values of \\(a\\) and \\(p\\), then treat the resulting \\(t_i\\) parameters as fixed and recompute the optimal \\(a\\) and \\(p\\) values. Then iterate until there’s some convergence. This avoids the problem of having to optimize all the parameters at once.\nThe EM algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a local maximum of the likelihood function, but it is not guaranteed to find the global maximum in general. The t-a-p model with individual truth values is a relatively uncomplicated problem, however.\nThe expression \\(ta + \\bar{a}p\\) in the likelihood function will be maximized when \\(t=1\\), whether or not a threshold function is used. The nature of the t-a-p model therefore prefers discrete truth values. This suggests a modified EM approach where we:\n\nE step. Compute the individual \\(t_i\\) truth parameters using the probabilistic approach, then round them to 0 or 1.\nM step. Compute the new fixed effects using the rounded random effects.\nRepeat until convergence.\n\nI have not yet tried this."
